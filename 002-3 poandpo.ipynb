      "AAIB investigating incident involving cargo aircraft that occurred at Exeter Airport Christian Fernsby ▼ | January 21, 2021   A team of inspectors are continuing to gather evidence on site at Exeter Airport where they are investigating an incident involving a cargo aircraft which occurred 19th January. On 19 January, a West Atlantic UK Boeing 737-400 freighter (registered G-JMCY) operated domestic cargo flight NPT05L between East Midlands Airport and Exeter Airport, United Kingdom. During landing at Exeter, however, the aircraft sustained extensive damage.  On social media platforms, users indicate that the aircraft got damaged to this extent after a hard touchdown and that Royal Mail was unable to offload the cargo. Reports suggest that the cargo was unable to be unloaded immediately. This was likely due to the creased door preventing access to the cargo bay. Both of the two crew onboard were reported to be safe and well. Meteorological data for Exeter at the time of the arrival, on runway 26, indicates light rain. Cirium fleet data lists the aircraft as having operated for Russian carrier Donavia before being acquired by Vx Capital Partners and converted to a freighter in 2016. A 1994 airframe was originally delivered to Alaska Airlines. ■\n",

      "One of 22 workers trapped in China mine explosion dies Christian Fernsby ▼ | January 21, 2021   One of the workers trapped in a Chinese gold mine for more than 10 days following an explosion has died, state media reported Thursday. The miner sustained serious head injuries when the mine under construction in east China collapsed and fell into a coma, after which he stopped showing vital signs and died late Wednesday, according to news agency Xinhua. Rescue operations were underway to extract the 21 miners still trapped in the mine. Of those, 10 have still not been contacted. Eight of the workers are in good health as they said via a telephone deployed through one of the channels dug by rescue teams. However, two others expressed slight discomfort. Rescuers have drilled several channels to also send them food and medical supplies including porridge, thermometers and blankets. The miners asked for a spare phone to be sent as water accumulating in the mine is causing signal failures while making contact, something that will be done several times a day to ease their anxiety. The authorities are studying how to carry out the rescue, a task of great difficulty because in some areas ventilation ducts, drainage pipes or electrical cables overlap. The National Health Commission sent a team of experts Tuesday from Beijing to the Qixia area, where the mine is located, to help in different fields of psychological and medical care – intensive care, neurosurgery, nutrition and poisoning. The rescue is challenging because managers did not inform authorities until 30 hours after the incident. Several people have been dismissed, including the two highest political leaders in the area and an official investigation is underway. China’s laws require the person in charge of an industrial unit in which an accident occurs to inform authorities within a maximum period of one hour. ■\n",

The Meteorological, Climatological and Geophysical Agency (BMKG) of Indonesia said that the quake’s epicentre was 10 km deep and 112 km southwest of the centre of Maluku. There has been no report on casualties or damage. On January 15, a earthquake of 6.2 magnitude claimed more than 90 lives and injured over 820 people in Majene district and coastal city Mamuju of West Sulawesi province. About 28,000 people were displaced. Grocery stores, gas stations and other shops were reopening in a quake-hit Indonesian city on Wednesday where debris still covered streets and searchers continued to dig in the rubble for more victims. Immediate food and water needs have been met and the local government has started to function again in the hardest-hit city of Mamuju and the neighbouring district of Majene on Sulawesi island, the National Disaster Mitigation Agency’s spokesperson Raditya Jati said in a statement. Thousands of people are sleeping outdoors, fearing aftershocks, and the streets of Mamuju were still covered in debris.

      "$8 million in fake Cartier bracelets seized by CBP in Cincinnati and Louisville Christian Fernsby ▼ | January 20, 2021   U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers continue to stop shipments that contain illicit goods that pose economic security risks. On January 14, in two separate locations, Cincinnati, Ohio, and Louisville, Kentucky, CBP officers halted shipments, arriving from Hong Kong, which contained more than 800 counterfeit designer bracelets. CBP officers in Cincinnati detained two parcels heading to a residence in West Palm Beach, Florida. CBP officers inspected the parcels to determine the admissibility of its contents in accordance with CBP regulations. Inside the first box officers found 267 Cartier bracelets, and the other box contained another 137 Cartier bracelets. On the same night, officers in Louisville were inspecting different parcels to determine their admissibility. A shipment arriving from same location in Hong Kong and heading to the same residence in West Palm Beach, Florida as Cincinnati’s parcel, was inspected and found to contain 401 Cartier rings and bracelets. The jewelry pieces were reviewed by an import specialist who determined the items were counterfeit. If these items were real, the total MSRP for Cincinnati’s seizure would have been over $4.17 million, while Louisville’s seizure would have been more than $4.55 million; a total of $8.72 million “This is a significant seizure for CBP, but unfortunately, CBP officers see counterfeit shipments like this every day,” said Richard Gillespie, Port Director-Cincinnati. “I’m extremely proud of these officers determination in stopping illicit shipments, and our commitment to protecting the American economy.” “Driven by the rise in E-commerce, the market for counterfeit goods in the United States has shifted in recent years from one in which consumers often knowingly purchased counterfeits to one in which counterfeiters try to deceive consumers into buying goods they believe are authentic,” said Thomas Mahn, Port Director-Louisville.. Consumers are unaware that they’re buying a dangerous product as the counterfeit is just that good.” ■\n",

The SLTDA reportedly said it had published a more relaxed set of safety protocols for visitors, which will allow the tourists to explore the island nation with fewer restrictions. The authority said the safety protocols have been approved by the Health Ministry. According to the renewed protocol, requirements for tourists entering the country include having a negative PCR test result from an accredited laboratory 96 hours before departure and staying at safe hotels during the initial 14 days of the trip. The hotels, which must be certified COVID-19 \"safe and secure\", will not be allowed to accept bookings to hold any events or banquet functions for locals, the SLTDA said. \"This ensures the creation of a bio-bubble for the international visitors, assuring the safety of the local communities, employees of the industry and the visitors to the industry,\" the SLTDA said. Sri Lanka will re-open its international airports on Jan. 21 for commercial flights after being shut since March, 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ■\n",

Less than 8,000 people live in Andorra, and France has agreed to send the country doses of the Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines as well. France will also send vaccines to Monaco, while Italy has agreed to supply San Marino and Vatican City. The Spanish Health Ministry said the vaccines will be resold to Andorra at the same price Spain paid. Spain expects to receive 4.5 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine before the end of March – enough to vaccinate 2.3 million people. Since Spain began vaccinating in late December, Pfizer has been sending the country around 350,000 doses per week. This week, however, Pfizer said shipments were being affected by changes to its manufacturing processes, so Spain received fewer than 200,000 doses. Spain has agreed to purchase 140 million vaccine doses for 80 million people this year, even though its population is just 47 million. The excess will be sent to non-EU countries under principles of “solidarity,” Health Minister Salvador Illa said. But for Spain to receive that many doses, vaccines made by AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Sanofi and GSK, and CureVac must be approved. The EU has approved only the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines so far, of which Spain has administered nearly 900,000 doses. ■\n",

Your average Aussie who heads off for a holiday is probably spending about 1,500 Australian dollars (about 1,156 U.S. dollars).\" \"Make no mistake, while international borders remain closed, we have no hope of recovery.\" Her comments came one day after Brendan Murphy, Department of Health Secretary, revealed that \"substantial border restrictions\" would likely remain in place for \"most\" of 2021. In response, Ormond called for the federal government to announce support for the tourism industry beyond the planned end of the JobKeeper wage subsidy scheme in March. \"The government is going to have to think very seriously about how it supports this industry for the next couple of years, not just the next couple of months, if it wants to have a tourism industry when we actually reopen our international borders,\" she said. However, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg on Monday again ruled out any extension to JobKeeper saying the temporary scheme had served its purpose during the worst of the pandemic in Australia. \"I'm confident that the key pillars of our economic response are in place,\" he said. ■\n",

In total, 112,476 residential sales transactions were concluded in 2020 in the province of Quebec. This represents a 17 per cent increase compared to 2019. It was also the highest number of sales ever registered since the real estate brokers’ Centris system began compiling market data in the year 2000. By property category, single-family homes stood out with a significant 18 per cent increase in sales across the province. Sales of plexes and condominiums also registered strong increases of 17 per cent and 13 per cent, respectively. Among the province’s metropolitan areas, Quebec City (+28 per cent), Sherbrooke (+22 per cent) and Gatineau (+15 per cent) registered the largest increases in sales. Overall, sales in regions outside of the metropolitan areas experienced an even more dramatic increase in sales (+31 per cent), all property categories combined. More specifically, several small urban resort areas registered phenomenal sales increases in 2020, including the agglomerations of Charlevoix (+94 per cent), Sainte-Agathe-des-Monts (+64 per cent), Mont-Tremblant (+59 per cent) and Sainte-Adèle (+57 per cent). Active listings There was an average of 39,848 active listings on the Centris system in Quebec in 2020, a 29 per cent drop compared to 2019.

The government says that these workers will play a vital role in helping horticulture growers pick and package their produce, whilst reducing their reliance on migrant labour as the country comes to terms with its painful exit from the EU. However, the high price of the permits – 244 UK pounds – may be far beyond many potential short-term workers, especially those from the east of Europe.

      "Cyprus to reopen airports on March 1 Christian Fernsby ▼ | January 21, 2021   Cyprus plans to reopen its airports to visitors from all countries on March 1, Deputy Tourism Minister Savvas Perdios told CyBC state television on Wednesday. \"This means that passengers will be able to visit Cyprus without quarantine restrictions, unless they test positive for COVID-19 on arrival,\" Perdios said. He said that the 56 countries with which Cyprus has an air connection will be designated colors according to their coronavirus pandemic situation. Passengers arriving from green category countries will not have to take a COVID-19 test, while those flying in from orange category countries will be obliged to present a negative test certificate before boarding a plane. Passengers arriving from red category countries will have to be tested both before boarding and after arrival. Perdios said he did not expect any tourists to arrive in the country before March 1 and preferred not to cite an estimate for tourist arrivals this year, saying only that currently all countries are facing a second or third wave of the coronavirus pandemic. \"It would be difficult for people to travel either now or even in February and March,\" he said. Cyprus' air connections are currently restricted to only a few countries, mainly Greece, Britain, Russia, Lebanon, Egypt and Gulf states. The Statistical Service of Cyprus has said that flights to and from Cyprus were reduced by 53 percent and tourism plunged by about 80 percent in 2020 year-on-year. In 2019, almost four million people visited the eastern Mediterranean island. Cyprus is currently under an almost total lockdown, with only essential businesses operating and a night-time curfew in force. A vaccination program is proceeding at a slow pace as a result of limited supplies, but the authorities say they expect most of the people to be vaccinated by early summer. ■\n",

      "Biden kills Keystone XL Pipeline, Alberta wants sanctions against U.S. Christian Fernsby ▼ | January 21, 2021   The premier of Canada’s Alberta province called for sanctions against the U.S. after newly elected President Joe Biden cancelled the CAN$8 billion Keystone XL Pipeline on Wednesday. “This is a gut punch for the Canadian and Alberta economies,” Jason Kenney said in a fiery press conference while responding to the cancellation of the pipeline, which would carry about 830,000 barrels a day of heavy crude oil extracted from Alberta’s oil sands fields to the U.S. state of Nebraska. It would then connect with an existing pipeline to flow the crude to U.S. Gulf Coast refineries. Thousands of jobs evaporate with the cancellation, and the Alberta government has invested CAN$1.5 billion in the pipeline, which has been under construction for months in Canada.    Kenney said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau should talk to Biden to try to get the project back on track. It was killed by then-president Barack Obama in 2015 and then given the green light again by former President Donald Trump early in his administration.  If the talks fail, Kenney called for retaliatory but unspecified economic sanctions against the U.S. In a news release Wednesday, builder TC Energy said the project would deliver “much needed energy in an environmentally responsible way while enhancing North American energy security.” ■\n",

At the meeting, the Polish prime minister said he will demand that there be no more changes that reduce the supply of the Pfizer vaccine and that all EU members keep to the system that was agreed to for ordering and distributing the vaccines. Pfizer has announced that it will temporarily reduce the number of vaccine doses delivered in order to reorganize production lines so that more doses can start to be produced. Morawiecki has reassured people in Poland that he is in contact with the European Council and the producers of the vaccines in order to ensure that commitments and procedures are adhered to. “During the meeting of the European Council, I will be demanding that there be no more changes in delivery schedules,” said the Polish prime minister. He added that the only changes acceptable for the future will be “increasing the size of deliveries”. ■\n",

On social media, Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard lauded the move to stop construction of the wall planned by former President Donald Trump as well as Biden’s push for undocumented immigrants to become citizens.   “Mexico welcomes the end of the construction of the wall, the immigration initiative in favor of DACA and a path towards dual citizenship,” Ebrard said. On his inauguration day, Biden signed a memorandum to preserve the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, which protects migrants who arrive in the country as children from being deported.   Biden also signed an immigration bill that will create a pathway for millions of migrants towards US citizenship. ■\n",

      "Czech lawmakers: Let’s be nationalists a bit when it comes to food Christian Fernsby ▼ | January 21, 2021   Czech lawmakers on Wednesday approved legislation requiring shops to sell mainly domestically made food that would benefit Czech producers. The measure stipulates that shops larger than 400 square metres must as of next year offer at least 55% of items that can be locally produced like fruit, vegetables, milk or meat. The proportion would rise gradually to 73% in 2028. The quotas are a part of a bill aimed at preventing double standards in food, an issue that some formerly communist eastern members of the European Union have pursued for years, contending that inferior food products unwanted by consumers in richer western EU states were being sold in poorer eastern markets. “Let’s be nationalists a bit when it comes to food, Czech agriculture and our country,” Agriculture Minister Miroslav Toman told parliament with respect to the legislation, which still must pass parliament’s upper house. Opponents said quotas would give windfall profits to large domestic producers, raise prices, cause shortages and violate EU internal market rules which could lead to sanctions. “This proposal goes straight against the (EU) free market principles,” opposition Pirate Party lawmaker Radek Holomcik said in the debate. ■\n",

In an interview, Ministry of Basic Education chief public relations officer, Mr Oarabile Phefo said the teams comprise education, public health and local government officials as well as teacher union representatives. He said the teams were scheduled to visit all the 756 primary schools, 207 junior secondary schools, two unified secondary schools and 32 senior secondary schools. He expressed the hope that by the end of the week, at least 80 per cent would have been inspected. Prior to the teams' visit, he said regional education officials would have carried out inspections to ensure schools' readiness to absorb all learners with respect to compliance to COVID-19 protocols. He said the teams, among other things, wanted to ensure that the environment was conducive for social distancing as well as to cater for emerging COVID-19 challenges. Mr Phefo said learners' numbers per classroom had reduced drastically and that about 3 000 more teachers had been hired to cater for additional classes. Government schools opened in a phased manner from January 12 to January 19 to ensure compliance to COVID-19 health protocols. ■\n",

      "Croatian PM Plenkovic says government will do its best to help earthquake victims Christian Fernsby ▼ | January 21, 2021   Presenting amendments to the Act on the Post-Earthquake Reconstruction in parliament on Wednesday, PM Andrej Plenković said that the government would do its best to help earthquake victims and that it was open to a consensus to achieve a long-lasting and sustainable solution. \"The aim was to provide more assistance than was the case after the first earthquake (in Zagreb) and to involve also the Central State Office for Housing Reconstruction to deal with reconstruction and housing issues in the government-assisted area under a 100% state funding scheme,\" Plenković said while presenting amendments that expand the law, originally intended for the City of Zagreb and Zagreb and Krapina-Zagorje counties, to apply also to Sisak-Moslavina and Karlovac counties, hit by a 6.2 magnitude quake at the end of last year. \"The government is ready to do its best to help people,\" he stressed. Under the amendments, the state will cover all reconstruction costs in government-assisted areas while in other areas 60% of the costs would be covered by the state, 20% by county authorities, or by the state if those authorities cannot do it, while 20% would have to be contributed by property owners, but if they cannot afford it, the state will do so, however, it will put a lien on the property, the PM said. \"No one has to contribute anything right away. That is an important detail,\" he said, calling on MPs to try and reach a consensus that would secure a fair, long-lasting and sustainable solution. He said that this was the last opportunity for a serious reconstruction and revitalisation of that part of Croatia, most of which is categorised as government-assisted. The earthquake damage in Sisak-Moslavina, Karlovac and Zagreb counties is huge even though we still do not have a complete picture, Plenković said, noting that family houses had been damaged the most. In Sisak-Moslavina County, applications have been submitted for the inspection of 36,617 buildings, 20,370 have been inspected and of them 2,575 are unusable while 4,212 are temporarily unusable. In Karlovac County, 804 buildings were reported, he said. Plenković said that HRK 77 million had been collected through fund-raising campaigns and that more than HRK 40 million had been paid into the account of the Red Cross Croatia. Referring to a speech by Bridge MP Marija Selak Raspudić who said Donja Stubica in Krapina-Zagorje County was in the same category as Petrinja in terms of the level of development, he said that she must have confused Donja Stubica with Gornja Stubica and explained that in Sisak-Moslavina County only the city of Sisak was in Group VI according to the development index. Under the Regional Development Act, local government units that fall into groups I-IV have the status of government-assisted local government units. Construction Minister Darko Horvat said that the state would fully finance reconstruction in government-assisted areas and that funds would be secured from the state budget, the EU Solidarity Fund, through World Bank loans and from other sources. The amended law will apply also to areas that could later be struck by an earthquake, he said. ■\n",

Among the 15 executive orders Biden signed Wednesday was an order to rejoin the Paris climate accord and end a Trump-era policy that blocked entry of people from several Muslim-majority countries. Biden made rejoining the climate agreement a key point of his presidential campaign, vowing to undue former president Donald Trump's policy. Biden also ended the entry ban on citizens from over a dozen countries, including Eritrea, Yemen, Nigeria and Sudan. Biden issued an executive order halting construction of a wall along the US border with Mexico, dealing a blow to one of Trump's signature policy goals meant to keep South American immigrants out of the US. The president also signed an executive order mandating that people wear masks in all federal buildings and on federal lands in an effort to fight the spread of the coronavirus. As part of his executive order Biden asked everyone in the United States to wear a mask when in public for at least the next 100 days. The president has also sent a bill to Congress to overhaul the country's immigration system, his team said earlier. ■\n",

The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) of the Philippines said the automaker informed it on Wednesday about the company's plan to shut down its assembly operations for its Almera model in the Philippines. According to the DTI, Nissan said the move is \"in line with the group's global plan to optimize production and efficient business operations in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region.\" \"The announcement of Nissan to close their assembly operations in the country is regrettable, as these developments all the more demonstrate the critical situation of the local motor vehicle industry,\" Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez said in a statement The DTI said that only 133 assembly workers are going to be affected by the closure, as operations of the company's marketing and distribution network will continue to sell units imported mainly from Thailand and Japan. Nissan is the third carmaker to close operations in the Philippines. Honda and Isuzu also shut down operations last year. Lopez said that Nissan had been mulling the closure of the assembly operations last year due to weaker volume sales and low market share of the Almera. In the Philippines, Nissan Almera's sales of around 4,500 represents just 1 percent of the total vehicle market. According to the DTI, since 2019, Nissan had already closed plants across Europe, the United States and some developing countries and have laid-off approximately 42,500 workers globally.  ■\n",

      "Swiss financial watchdog investigated Julius Baer for alleged Venezuela money laundering Christian Fernsby ▼ | January 21, 2021   The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority FINMA has investigated the responsibility of individuals for serious breaches of anti-money laundering regulations by Julius Baer, particularly in connection with alleged cases of corruption in Venezuela. These investigations concerned in particular four high-ranking managers. FINMA launched enforcement proceedings in one case. In a second case, FINMA discontinued proceedings after the person concerned had credibly agreed not to accept a managerial position at a supervised institution in the future. Finally, FINMA reprimanded two further people in writing. FINMA can ban individuals who are responsible for a serious breach of supervisory law from acting in a senior role at an organisation it supervises. The prohibition from practising a profession may be imposed for a period of up to five years. The measure has a preventive character. Its purpose in particular is to prevent the person concerned or other financial market players from committing similar violations of the law in the future. As a supervisory authority tasked primarily with preventing future damage, however, FINMA can forego industry and activity bans if individuals have left the supervised sector for good. FINMA has used the tool of imposing an industry ban in particular since 2014. It has issued around 60 such bans. Managers at all levels of organisations were affected. To issue an industry ban, FINMA must be able to prove direct, individual and causal responsibility for the serious violation of supervisory law. There must be a proven breach of duty that has specifically led to these violations. It is not sufficient under supervisory law to derive responsibility for legal violations solely from a person’s hierarchical level or position or from decisions on the direction of strategy. Although mistakes were made in the case of the two reprimanded managers, there are not sufficient indications of direct, causal responsibility for the serious violation of supervisory law. FINMA was in contact with over 30 Swiss banks in connection with alleged cases of corruption linked to the Venezuelan oil company PDVSA. FINMA investigated whether and to what extent the banks were involved in this case and whether the provisions of Swiss supervisory law were upheld. FINMA ultimately opened five enforcement proceedings in order to investigate specific information it had received regarding possible violations of money-laundering rules (cf. press release and press release). Two proceedings are still outstanding. ■\n",

The $145,000 expansion at 272 East Ferry Street, which was supported by funding from the state's East Side Corridor Economic Development Fund and Buffalo Billion II initiative, provides greater access to fresh fruit and vegetables for a neighborhood partially covered by a USDA-designated second standard food desert.

      "Largest £1.7bn UK export guarantee goes to Bombardier Christian Fernsby ▼ | January 20, 2021   A consortium led by Bombardier Transportation has confirmed a deal with the Egyptian Government to build two new monorails thanks to £1.7 billion backing from UK Export Finance (UKEF), the largest amount of financing it has ever provided for an overseas infrastructure project. International Trade Secretary Liz Truss today announced the government guarantee, which will support highly skilled jobs in Derbyshire as the UK builds back better in the aftermath of coronavirus. Bombardier’s consortium was named preferred bidder for the project at the 2020 UK-Africa Investment Summit and, with UKEF’s guarantee, has secured the financing needed to fulfil the contract and start production. Bombardier can now invest in its manufacturing centre in Derby where the trains for the Egyptian monorails will be designed and built. This will be the UK’s only monorail car production line and will directly support 100 UK jobs at the company and many more in its UK supply chain. Bombardier employs 4,000 people in the UK, with around 2,000 in Derby including over 400 specialised engineers, who develop and build trains for rail franchises across Britain. This expertise will be used to build and maintain two electrified monorails that together will transport millions of people every year in the Cairo metropolitan area. The new lines will connect the New Administrative City with East Cairo and 6th October City with Giza. The monorails are a part of Egypt’s plans to build a sustainable transportation infrastructure that can cope with its growing population while reducing climate change impacts. Bombardier also sees additional opportunities to increase its exports of UK built trains using its new production line as global demand for fast, sustainable public transportation solutions increases. The UKEF supported Buyer Credit facility will be administered by JP Morgan acting as the Initial Mandated Lead Arranger and the Facility Agent. Reinsurance support has also been secured with the help of Italian ECA SACE and Spanish ECA CESCE. ■\n",

      "Port of Los Angeles to reward container terminals for higher truck productivity Christian Fernsby ▼ | January 20, 2021   The Port of Los Angeles is launching a new incentive program to move trucks faster and more efficiently through its terminals. The Port’s Truck Turn-Time and Dual-Transaction Incentive Programs offer terminal operators two ways to earn financial rewards: one for shortening the time it takes to process trucks dropping off and/or picking up cargo, and the other for trucks handling both transactions in the same trip. Drayage trucks handle approximately three-quarters of all import and export containers moving through the Port. In recent months, imports have dominated the flow of cargo, draining the market of containers needed for exports. The imbalance has also reduced the number of chassis in circulation, caused inbound containers to stack up on terminals, and slowed the movement of trucks in and out of terminals. Under the new incentive program approved by the Los Angeles Harbor Commission, terminals that improve truck turn times by 5% to 20% can earn between 50 cents and $2.75 per loaded or empty Twenty-foot Equivalent Unit (TEU), the standard measure for intermodal containers. The rate of the reward increases on a sliding scale as terminals improve turn times. If a terminal averages turn times of 35 minutes or less in a given month, it will earn the top rate of $3 per loaded or empty container. Additionally, terminals can earn between 40 cents and $1.40 per loaded TEU when at least half of all trucks calling their facilities drop off one container and depart with another on the same trip. The percentage is based on the number of dual transactions out of all gate moves for the month. Like the turn-time incentive, the rate of the reward increases as the terminal’s percentage of dual transactions grows. Both incentive programs begin Feb. 1 and are based solely on TEUs handled by truck. Incentives will be paid monthly as long as the program remains in effect. For the first year of the program, the Port’s cost is estimated at $7.5 million. To participate, container terminals must opt in and provide additional details on truck moves. The data will be collected and processed by the Port Optimizer, the tool the Port uses to keep its supply chain partners current on the status of cargo before it arrives, so terminals, trucking companies, railroads and others can plan and allocate resources in advance. No proprietary information is shared. The Truck Turn-Time and Dual-Transaction Incentive Programs are the latest in a series of Port initiatives aimed at boosting cargo efficiency and fluidity. In September, the Port launched The Signal, the Port’s new dashboard for sharing data on inbound containers three weeks before their arrival. In November, the Port added “The Return Signal” to the Port Optimizer site so the trucking community knows when and where to return empty containers throughout the San Pedro Bay complex. ■\n",

However, according to provisional calculations, the economic slump was less severe than during the 2009 financial crisis, when Germany's economy shrank by 5.7 percent. The contraction was much smaller than many experts had feared in the course of the year, said German Minister for Economic Affairs and Energy Peter Altmaier at a press conference on Thursday. Albert Braakmann, who heads Destatis' National Accounts section, said the German economy \"has come relatively well through the crisis\" in 2020 compared with many other nations, German news agency dpa reported. Altmaier is confident that the economy will return to growth in 2021 despite the pandemic, saying that Europe's biggest economy will recover this year and \"there will be an upswing year,\" dpa said. The German government will continue to provide the necessary financial resources \"to protect the German economy from an irreversible loss of substance,\" Altmaier stressed. However, the coronavirus pandemic left \"clear traces\" in almost all economic sectors in Germany last year, according to Destatis. Production was \"severely scaled-down\" both in the service sector and in industry. The country's industry -- excluding construction, which accounts for about a quarter of its overall economy -- saw output fall by 9.7 percent year-on-year. The economic output of the important manufacturing sector even fell by 10.4 percent. Despite the COVID-19-induced recession, online trade increased significantly. Another sector in Germany that could sustain its business during the pandemic was construction, where gross value added increased by 1.4 percent year-on-year. Germany's foreign trade, on the other hand, was \"massively impacted\" by the crisis, Destatis noted. Exports and imports of goods and services fell for the first time since 2009. German exports decreased by 9.9 percent in price-adjusted terms and imports decreased by 8.6 percent. In 2020, the German labor force shrank by 477,000 people, or 1.1 percent, year-on-year, ending a 14-year surge in employment due to the coronavirus pandemic. According to preliminary calculations, Germany's general government budget closed last year with a financing deficit of 158.2 billion euros (191.8 billion U.S. dollars). \"It was the first deficit since 2011 and the second highest deficit since the German reunification,\" Destatis noted.  ■\n",

      "Is America going to lose its superpower status? Surjit Singh Flora ▼ | September 28, 2020   As the U.S. presidential election approaches, there seems to be no progress. Taking liberal democracy as an example, people question whether they will respect the people's fate that appeared in November. People are worried that it will provoke violence that has increased polarization. In fact, this situation is beyond control in some respects. For example, Washington's strategy for dealing with coronavirus. So careless that no one expects the United States to respond. The coronavirus that broke out in Wuhan, China in January, became a global epidemic by the end of February. Without effective treatment, there is no choice but to shut down the entire economy. As a result, the unemployment problem in the United States today is as dire as the Great Depression. It is feared that nearly one million small enterprises in the United States are on the verge of closure. Simultaneously, the conflict with China on the trade and technology front has become a fundamental clash of global politics in which there is no prospect of peace. Corona is still making waves in the United States. There is no prospect of relief from the virus. The political leadership seems helpless in mitigating the damage caused by this epidemic. Under such circumstances, the image of the world leader that the United States has created for itself seems to be disappearing. The catastrophe has exposed America's weakness as a welfare state, and its helpless policies have exacerbated the current crisis. About 43 percent of people in the United States do not have access to health insurance. These people do not even have access to government health facilities. In such a situation, this calamity has become a significant problem for them. Admit it was not enough for America's difficulties. When the Corona Crisis was on the rise, police brutality sparked racial tensions in the United States. The death of George Floyd, a 46-year-old African American man, in May has provoked strong reactions in the United States. This led to a flood of protests, violence, riots, and police action. According to a survey, about 55 percent of Americans believe that police violence is a major problem. Simultaneously, 58 percent support the idea that racism is one of the most significant issues in the world today. Similarly, two-thirds of Americans feel that their country is heading in the wrong direction. A country that speaks to the rest of the world on governance and human rights and considers itself a world leader seems to be failing to address its internal problems. Protests continue in the United States today. This is further polarizing American society. In such a difficult situation, the political leadership does not seem keen to unite the people and the country. In fact, it is an election period, and it is important to please one's vote bank. That is why U.S. President Donald Trump is trying to portray it as a law and order problem. He attacked his political opponents with such harsh words that only a dead Democrat is really a good Democrat. Trump is also making frivolous remarks about his Democratic rival, Joe Biden. Their frustration is probably since they are lagging behind Biden in many polls. This means that most Americans are unhappy with Trump's policies. That’s why they seem to be leaning towards Biden. At present, the reputation of American institutions is in jeopardy. Police brutality has led to the deaths of people belonging to minority communities, and discrimination against African Americans in corona treatment has fueled protests. The issue of race is at the heart of American society and the system. As far as handling internal affairs is concerned, the United States, which has often looked down on other countries, in this regard, today suffers from an internal lack of solidarity for which no solution is currently in sight. Because of Trump, sooner or later The US will soon lose its status as a superpower because it will stop being the center for innovation. For the past few years, economic wealth has been created around technology companies. Amazon. Google, Apple, Tesla, Uber. Before that, Oracle, IBM, Intel, Qualcomm, eBay, Yahoo. What do these companies have in common? Immigrants and sons of immigrants founded them. This is not rhetoric. In the past few years, many entrepreneurs who decided against coming to the US because of its new Trump's anti-immigration policies and honestly, because America is losing its status as a great country when a clown and his circus run it. As a result, new innovation centers are popping up all over the world from Amsterdam to Guadalajara. The next-generation Microsoft, Tesla, and Amazon might be Indian, Swedish, or Chinese companies. It's happening right now. The next Nikola Tesla, and Werner von Braun and Albert Einstein’s are not welcome in America anymore. The US is no longer a country that welcomes bright minds who want to work hard to change the world. The change is happening right now, and at least part of it is irreversible. The consequences of the coronavirus epidemic, the increasing socio-economic diversity, the rise of nationalism, and the combination of racial tensions will shape the United States in their own way. Some see it as the end of American supremacy in world affairs. True or not, the United States has an immense potential to get itself out of trouble.

      "The challenge of Africa is not the same as Qatar’s. It is a lot harder Robert Brooks ▼ | December 2, 2019   Commenting on 'Africa can’t duplicate Qatar’s LNG experience but it can learn', Robert Brooks, PhD, founder of RBAC, Inc., says it's an 'interesting article, but not quite accurate or complete.' But even more importantly, Qatar has a very different culture and completely different demographics than the African countries the author describes. Although I don’t have deep knowledge of Qatar, I believe it is similar to the Emirates – a small indigenous population with a large mostly guest worker population (about 8,000,000) doing all the manual labor for its actual citizens (about 1,000,000). In the UAE, 3 million bbl / day oil production in Abu Dhabi produces enough revenue to dole out enormous welfare to the citizens, keeping them happy under a reasonably benign ruling class. I just did a bit more research and found that the population of Qatar includes 330,000 Qataris who make up 10.5% of the total population. This is not what you are going to see in any African country. In Africa you have large populations of desperately poor citizen workers and unemployed, a small but growing middle class of merchants and entrepreneurs, and an even smaller elite of corrupt kleptocratic “leaders”. In addition, their large populations are divided up into tribal groups that seem to be eternally at war with each other. The “leaders” are usually from one of these tribes, which then gets preferential treatment compared with the others.  Nigeria is a truly unfortunate example of this. One of the richest countries in the world in regard to resources, its leaders have never seriously agreed to create the conditions for ALL of its various tribes and their members to participate in the equitable and sustainable exploitation of those resources for all of their benefit. Other West and Central African countries are not so blessed with resources (except perhaps Congo), but have similar situations regarding poverty and exploitation. Many of them have engaged in civil wars over the past couple of decades, but except for the Boko Haram in Nigeria and surrounding countries and some seemingly never-ending trouble in Congo, this has largely subsided. As a result of this relative peace, various oil and gas developers have begun to explore the potential for these resources in places other than Nigeria where development began long ago. So the opportunity for economic development based on local gas-to-power and liquefied natural gas exports is definitely there. The important question is whether the leaders of these countries will set aside their historically corrupt ways and the producers will resist the temptation to make corrupts deals just to get the deals done. Together they could create wealth that could be successfully invested in the sustainable development of these countries while still yielding an acceptable return for the producers. This is the challenge of Africa. It is not the same as Qatar’s challenge or that of the Emirates. It is a lot harder. But I hope and pray that the leaders of these African countries and the producers can take an enlightened attitude into their negotiations and together create the basis for bringing their countries out of poverty and into full participation in the global 21st century economy. After all they’ve been through, these people deserve that opportunity.  BIOGRAPHY Dr. Brooks is the Founder of RBAC Inc.

      "Africa can’t duplicate Qatar’s LNG experience but it can learn NJ Ayuk ▼ | November 23, 2019   As I got into the process of writing my recent book Billions At Play, The future of African Energy and doing deal, the story of Qatar intrigued me. Its success is contagious and African LNG producers can learn from this country. Qatar learned that it possessed truly huge reserves of natural gas in 1971, when Royal Dutch/Shell discovered the North Dome structure, also known as the North field. At the time, though, neither Shell nor Qatar’s government had a great deal of interest in developing the site. Their focus was on crude oil, which was then making the country very rich. As a result, nothing much happened at North Dome for more than a decade. Shell did not actively pursue development work there, and neither did Qatar General Petroleum Co. (QGPC, now known as Qatar Petroleum or QP), which was the beneficiary of Doha’s nationalization of the oil and gas industry in 1977. Qatari crude production started to decline after 1979 as the country’s largest oil fields matured. In turn, international oil companies (IOCs) began to lose interest in signing service contracts with QP, since they did not believe Qatar’s aging reserve base warranted massive long-term investments. These developments did not have much immediate impact, since crude prices were rising enough to keep revenues high. But in the 1980s, oil prices sank and brought oil revenues down along with them. As a result, Qatar’s government began looking for new ways to generate income. Gas was an obvious option, since global demand was rising and national reserves were ample. Officials in Doha began to draw up plans for monetizing production from the North field, which is now known to contain at least 450 trillion cubic feet (13 trillion cubic meters) of gas in recoverable reserves. Eventually, they developed a three-phase plan that called for beginning with domestic sales and then proceeding to pipeline exports before finally launching marine exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG). To implement the plan, they set up a joint venture known as Qatar Liquefied Natural Gas Co. Ltd. (Qatargas) between QP, BP (UK) and Total (France). The first phase, which provided for domestic gasification, was a relatively simple process due to the small size of Qatar’s population. But events in the late 1980s and early 1990s made the second phase, which called for the construction of an export pipeline capable of delivering up to 20 billion cubic meters per year to other member-states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), more difficult. There were multiple reasons for this. Doha floated proposals for alternative routes in the hope of drawing interest from markets outside the GCC, but to no avail. The failure of the pipeline gave Qatargas an opportunity to skip the second phase of the project and proceed directly to the third – namely, using production from the North field as feedstock for a gas liquefaction plant that could turn out LNG for export by tanker. At the same time, rising demand for gas in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan gave Qatar an incentive to focus on LNG. Additionally, BP made the decision to exit Qatargas, the venture formed to develop North. This cleared the way for the U.S. company Mobil (now part of ExxonMobil) to join the project. That facility brought its first 2 million ton per year production train on line in late 1996 and began commercial production and exports the following year. Since then, Qatar has continued to ramp up gas production and to expand its LNG industry. It has worked with foreign partners to build more gas liquefaction facilities and is now home to three LNG mega-trains with a combined production capacity of 77 million tons per year. These plants helped make Qatar into the world’s largest LNG producer in 2006, and they have kept the country at the top of the list ever since. Meanwhile, Doha decided last year to build another mega-train that will raise the figure to 110 million tons per year by 2024. Qatar operates the largest fleet of LNG tankers in the world, and its LNG goes to customers all over the world. In short, its LNG program has been a smashing success. The story of Qatar’s success is interesting in its own right. But does it have any deeper meaning? Could it serve as a template – that is, as a map that other gas-producing countries can use to blaze their own trails toward success? I believe it can. Specifically, I believe African gas producers pursuing LNG projects have a lot to earn from Qatar. They will have a better chance of maximizing their gains if they follow Qatar’s example. Qatar began looking into plans for launching LNG production less than a decade after nationalizing its own oil and gas industry. Even so, it had a clear understanding of the fact that it could not pursue this goal without outside help. More specifically, QP and the Qatari government knew they would need partners with plenty of cash, experience, and access to gas liquefaction technology. They also knew they would need partners that were willing to absorb the risks involved in opening up a new frontier. Africa’s future LNG producers like Senegal, Equatorial Guinea, Mozambique, Tanzania, Congo, Cameroon, South Africa, Nigeria and Angola will need help too. Like Qatar, they will need to pair up with IOCs that can help cover the costs of establishing a new sector of industry, that have experience in handling all of the physical and logistical complications of such projects, and that can supply the sophisticated technologies needed to compress and cool gas into a liquid state that can be transported by tanker. Also like Qatar, they will need investors that are ready to build this sector of the economy from the ground up (this last point is particularly important in countries such as Mozambique, Tanzania, Senegal and South Africa that are trying to launch LNG projects in short order after the first discoveries of gas.) Qatargas’ original plan called for starting small, with domestic gasification, and hen scaling up. But as noted above, efforts to move the pipeline phase of the project forward foundered due to unexpected obstacles. Instead of focusing on these obstacles, Qatargas decided instead to take a different approach. It accepted that its efforts to draw up new plans and engage in further negotiations had failed, and it moved on. It dispensed with the second phase of the project altogether and got to work on the third phase. And that marked the first step of Qatar’s journey to becoming the largest LNG producer in the world. This is an important lesson for Africa’s future LNG producers: sometimes the original plan simply doesn’t work out, even when all parties make good-faith efforts to resolve their differences. So, it’s time to try something different. It’s time to look for a new solution. Qatar can also teach African gas producers a thing or two about resource management. This is a crucial consideration for QP and its partners in Qatargas, since most of their feedstock comes from a single source – the North field. This field may be huge, but it is hardly inexhaustible. In fact, Doha imposed a moratorium on new development initiatives at North in 2005. The moratorium was not permanent. Qatar’s government lifted it in 2017, and QP responded by drawing up plans for the North Field Expansion (NFE) project and for the construction of new gas liquefaction facilities. In September of this year, the company said it had shortlisted several firms and invited to bid for the NFE contract. These events are significant because they demonstrate that Qatar wants to keep its LNG plants in business for a long, long time. They show that the country is willing to accept some short-term setbacks in order to ensure that its largest source of gas can remain in production over the long term. Africa can’t duplicate Qatar’s experience. But it can learn from Qatar’s example and create a little bit of its own luck. Hopefully, Africa can benefit from the fact that global demand for gas is still rising and will continue to do so for some time, even as more and more consumers pin their hopes on renewable energy. Now is certainly a good time to try –not least because LNG projects should also generate interest in gas-to-power projects and other African initiatives. The Gas Exporting Countries Forum’s meeting in Malabo Equatorial Guinea will be a good start.

      "When you’re a leader, business productivity means accomplishing what matters most Jas Darar ▼ | October 29, 2019   A lot of people in business are under the impression that the more things they do, the more productive they become. They look at their daily checklist and see a lot of items crossed off, and then they feel proud about themselves. Sometimes, it’s not just about the amount of work done, but the quality of work you’ve invested your time and energy on. What if the items on your checklist aren’t supposed to be there in the first place? That means you spent precious resources working on things that could’ve been spent on more pressing matters. Despite the number of tasks you’ve accomplished, you’ve essentially not accomplished that much at all. In my extensive experience as a Business Coach, I’ve worked with a lot of business owners, and one of the most predominant characteristic among them is that they lack the skill of determining what’s important or not, which causes them to waste their time and energy on trivial pursuits. To become truly productive, most business leaders need guidance. Below are some tips on how to make the most of your time in running your business. Optimise your to-do list You need to know how to prioritise to be productive. The problem with most to-do lists is that business leaders tend to line up the wrong activities. They tend to work on important issues that feel pressing rather than on where time can be most efficiently spent. Don’t just list things down; rank them according to priority. The worst thing you can do is list down something that someone else can do. What good will that bring? You’re a business leader, and you should be focusing on bigger things that keep your company afloat. Think of activities that only you could and should do, and make sure the direction is in the interest of the company. Learn to anticipate crunch time The true measure of a productive leader is his behavior under pressure. Some leaders fold, while some leader remain composed and collected. The difference? A productive leader knows how to anticipate the part of the day when it gets busiest. That way, he can spend off-peak house accomplishing things ahead of time, so as the pressure builds up, he doesn’t scramble and panic. Most effective leaders tackle their most difficult tasks first at the beginning of the day. Once they have that out of the way, they start working their way down the list with less pressing obligations. That saves them from anxiety whether something unexpected comes up. Know what problem you are trying to solve You’d be surprised how many business leaders can run around, working on something, but have actually lost sight of the problem they set out to solve in the first place. They key is to keep the problem front and center, thus exponentially increasing your effectiveness. If you have the problem in front of you, you become more focused and you start asking the right questions and come up with the right ideas. When a crisis arises, the first thing you need to do is to identify the problem. Give it a name. Write it on the board in big bold letters. That will keep you in orbit as you work towards coming up with a resolution with your team. Focus on outcomes, not actions Just as much as you need to focus on the problem, you also need to focus on outcomes. When you do that, you find the critical paths and the short-cuts. Whereas, when you focus on actions, you may end up wasting time on things but don’t necessarily achieve results that help solve the main problem. Immediately start asking yourself, “What’s the goal?” or “What’s the outcome?” and you will quickly find yourself getting clarity on the situation. It will realign your effort and energy in a more meaningful way and help you avoid unnecessary distractions. Always make it a team effort It’s always an uphill battle if you take on everything by yourself. Productivity doesn’t mean you don’t need the help of others. In fact, if you’re good at delegation, it makes you a more productive leader. That means you’re able to effectively identify which tasks are for your team and which ones are yours. You can achieve better team collaboration if you make an effort to involve them as early as possible. Collect their insights and have them sit in on important decisions that have to be made. Good communication helps them understand the bigger picture and as a result, they can envision what contribution they could make to achieve the goals.

      "Fighting fraud from the top: Illegal activities have simple beginnings Ayanda Kotobe ▼ | September 12, 2019   Why do we stop at traffic lights? It's not because we are naturally attuned to seeing red as the order to stop. If that were the case, red dresses and apples wouldn't be as popular as they are! Red catches our attention, but we stop at a red light because everyone else does. Humans copy each other. It's often said that if you want someone to be more comfortable with you, mimic how they sit or stand. Psychologists call this ‘mirroring', but it doesn't just happen during social gatherings. Seeing someone drop a bit of trash or cutting a traffic light gives us a slight nudge into thinking it's okay. If they are doing it, maybe I can too. Fraud is at its essence the result of mirroring. It would be convenient to consider all fraudsters as hardened criminals who'd sell their granny if the price were right. But fraud investigators often point out that such activities have simple beginnings. The Enron scandal, so devastating that it destroyed an American energy giant, had its roots in some minor manipulations to meet earnings expectations. Yet when the people involved got away with that, they scaled up and even justified their actions as legitimate at least to themselves. This is why fraud prevention starts at the top. There has to be no tolerance among an organisation's leaders for fraud. When accountability and consequences are lacking, fraud will thrive. The culture of an environment, as well as its treatment of ethics and governance, will reflect management's attitude towards fraud. Leadership attitudes are fundamental, reinforced by internal controls to spot fraud. Illegal activities usually involve acts that siphon amounts from a business' coffers. These can include payroll fraud, writing double cheques for payments, skimming tax money or over-ordering1. A common fraud in South Africa and elsewhere is to overvalue a purchase and split the difference with the supplier. More recent activities include credit card fraud and bank scams. The Bankers Association of Botswana warned last year that fraudsters are becoming increasingly savvy about loopholes, especially technology ones, that organisations are not fixing fast enough. In all these examples, it only takes a few people to abuse the trust they earned. Sadly, it's the company that suffers when their wrongdoing is uncovered, usually because it became cataclysmic... These can be prevented by internal checks and structures to monitor governance and compliance. Companies should also create pipelines for concerned parties and whistle-blowers to relay their suspicions. The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) sets out the following five components for an effective fraud prevention system2: control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information & communication, and monitoring. These work together to establish sound internal controls through directed leadership, shared values and a culture that supports accountability. Increasingly, more of these controls can be automated in modern companies, particularly where high transaction volumes take place. It's additionally effective to consolidate suppliers to a few that you know can be trusted and are serious about their integrity. Creating reliable procurement channels with those suppliers will help employees stick to legitimate activities. There is also no reason any more to be ignorant of a company's finances: even if you have accountants and other fiscal gatekeepers, it is possible with modern software services to generate ad hoc reports and scrutinise patterns using visualisation dashboards. At Kenya's major banks, employee fraud is often a greater risk than third-party fraud. Headline-grabbing South African frauds such as seen at Fidentia and Steinhoff were perpetrated by the very accountants meant to have policed such activities. It might sound as if the fight against fraud means reducing trust in employees. This isn't the case. Instead, it is about narrowing those gaps where fraud might take place, so as not to normalise such activities. The tone should start at the top, from leadership and management who embrace sound controls and good governance. Consequences must be enforced and felt. Everyone will eventually ignore a traffic light if they see enough people do this. In some countries, you can see traffic officers haplessly direct vehicles that ignore them. Are all those drivers criminals? In terms of traffic laws, yes. But did they start as criminals? No. And do they see their behaviour as bad? It's unlikely. Not until they are caught - and if it were business fraud, by then it might be too late for their employers.

      "Premier of Ontario is singing 'Cut!' song while patients are in hallways Surjit Singh Flora ▼ | July 19, 2019   It seems that the fate of the beleaguered Premier Doug Ford was just a bit bigger than the need to improve the condition of patient's treatment in hallways. Ford said that the PC party would end hallway medicine within 12 months. At the time the government was formed last year, he also claimed that patients had to wait for five hours for a doctor to be seen. Perhaps he was not thinking of the location of Brampton's emergency patients having to wait for all night for a doctor, not just five hours. Now, there are around 1,000 patients in Ontario in hospital hallways at any given time. Ford assured Ontarians that they should expect that any patients in hallways will not be there for the next year. However, it will likely take longer than a year to end overcrowding in Ontario's hospitals despite Ford’s promise, the province’s health minister said Monday. Just days after Ford's declaration, Health Minister Christine Elliott downplayed his remarks, saying he was articulating the government's \"wishes\", but the problem is more complex than that. \"The premier is expressing that we're trying to do it as quickly as possible,\" Elliot said. \"While we hope that it will be within the next year, it may take a little bit longer.\" From both Premier Ford and Elliott's announcements, it seems the right-hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing, and the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing. Neither seems well informed about what they are doing.... all they are singing is one song. “Cut! Cut!! Cuttttt!!” As if cutbacks are going to create more beds. I guess Doug's idea of ending hallway healthcare means patients will be removed from hallways and placed in at the parking lots. Maybe he can explain in more detail. If we translate Elliott's words, is she hinting that Ontario voters believe that the Premier is not trustworthy and his \"promises\" are just falsehoods? Elliott told voters in October that the Conservative label worn by Ford and Scheer cannot be trusted nor believed. Hallway medicine at Brampton Civic Hospital and other Ontario hospitals doesn't appear to be going anywhere anytime soon. Brampton Civic is an absolute mess. The staff are trying their best, but the wait times are appalling. Peel Memorial Hospital, which was shut down in 2007, has been brought back only as an urgent care center that is open only from 8 in the morning  10 in the evening  Monday through Sunday. During the last six months, my brother was an out-patient in the emergency departments in Brampton hospitals, and few family members also had to go to different hospitals in Toronto and Mississauga. I have witnessed \"hallway healthcare\" on many occasions. It is evident to me, as someone without medical training, that the circumstances that resulted in patients sleeping and being treated in hallways, and other unusual locations, are numerous and complex. Ford was speaking in blatant ignorance when he boasted that he would end the problem within one year. Elliott, who does know the complexity of the issue, did a service to nobody when she attempted to backpedal his remarks. Last year’s bombshell internal memo obtained by Toronto media revealed that 4,352 patients were treated in the hospital's hallways. Between Apr. 2016 and Apr. 2017, the government announced 2,000 new hospital beds for the entire province, with just 37 of them going to BCH. During that same period, 4,352 people were treated int Brampton. Many patients have had to stay in the hallways from 40 - 70 hours. One woman, Jamie Lynn Ball, spent five days in a Brampton hospital hallway. There still isn’t much improvement in the situation, especially when compared to other cities, as hospital accommodation in Brampton has only increased. Brampton Civic can treat approximately 90,000 patients a year. In contrast, in the year 2016-17, 388,000 patients were coming for treatment. Brampton's population is rising 16-20 per cent annually, so it can be estimated that the situation will be worse. Both the minister and the Premier should refrain from making factual statements by two things. The first and most important thing is that serious efforts need to be made to improve the services in Ontario. This requires lesser 'income' and more funds. Secondly, in view of the federal elections being held in October, they are not getting anything more than blowing up federal Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer, playing the game of 'Combined,' and it will backfire both federally and provincially.

      "You need to accept the importance of good leadership and its impact on business success Jas Darar ▼ | May 10, 2019   Leadership involves a dynamic mix of behaviors, mindset, and skills, which are used to motivate people where a leader wants them to be for the furtherance of an organisation. It’s what he does, not his title, that makes someone a leader.  And these ‘actions’ must be consistent with the leader’s and the company’s whys — the ultimate objectives. So what kind of actions make a leader effective? It’s your responsibility to establish the company’s vision and performance expectations Leaders are known to be brilliant communicators. Being one is a necessity. How else would you expect to get your team member on-board with your vision and enlighten them with the steps needed to achieve this vision? This starts with a leader having to be genuine meaning, he has to know who he is and what his values are, as well as what his plans for the future are. Transmitting your enthusiasm for the future is a surefire way to get your team to buy into your vision. But, you also need to be able to explicitly explain the performance expectations to your team so that they can see the bigger picture. You have to make lightning fast decisions with a good level of effectiveness Leaders are known for being expert decision makers. They’re also known for making these decisions exceptionally fast. Why fast? Because during crunch time is when great leaders present themselves. You must know which decisions will have the biggest impact. You must be able to think rationally about how your options align with the ultimate objectives — your company’s whys. You have to be okay with putting the spotlight on others Truly great leaders rarely make themselves the center of attention. They recognise and showcase their gratitude, of the hard work, dedication, success, and even other leadership efforts from team members. They also inspire others to share their ideas and to speak-up so that they can voice their perspectives or point-of-view. Working hard as a leader should not be fueled by attaining a certain degree of personal triumph. It is only through sharing the spotlight with others that a leader truly achieve success. You need to accept full responsibility of actions, especially the bad ones Successful leaders don’t make excuses or throw their team under the bus when something didn’t go as planned. They don’t humiliate employees in front of everyone. They take full responsibility and blame. And, if they feel a team member made a mistake, they give this feedback to them in private. There is nothing worse than a leader that likes to point fingers when things go south. You need to learn to take risks without being reckless Everything that is worth doing involves risk. But there’s a difference between taking risks and taking calculated risks. To become an outstanding leader, you must understand the importance of taking risks, and you must be willing to try something new. Use your existing knowledge and expertise, resources, and intuition to judge whether or not the risk is worth it. Make sure the risks you’re taking would not jeopardise the team, and again, be accountable in the event that the risk does not pay off. You have to lead by example While this is a rather cliché statement, it doesn't make it any less true. The best of leaders are the ones who “walk the walk.” If you want your team members to act and behave in a certain way, then be the first one to observe that behavior. And don’t do it just to be an example; do it because you genuinely believe in those principles. Once your team members view you as hard working, trustworthy, transparent, ethical, and someone who treats everyone with respect, it will be extremely easier to motivate them to work towards your personal and business goals.

      "Despite heated debate, ban on cellphones in Canada is good step Surjit Singh Flora ▼ | March 26, 2019   Access to mobile technology can be both a blessing and a curse. Smartphones are used to make calls to loved ones, make business communications and organize our social lives. But they also raise concerns due to their impact on our health, society and the way we learn. In Ontario, parents, students and educators are involved in a heated debate as to whether or not children should be allowed to take cellphones to school. For parents who are concerned about their child’s academic performance the answer is probably “no.” They fear the phones will be used more for socializing than for studying. And how can teachers be sure that students are using their phones as learning tools? It’s not unfair to say that students having cellphones in class adds another potential distraction to the learning environment. However, those same phones are also a valuable resource for innovative teachers. Cellphones provide an opportunity to develop innovative learning strategies, including use of the internet which gives students access to a knowledge base far beyond the constraints of the classroom. Whether we embrace it or not, mobile technology is a fundamental part of the modern world and will play an even bigger role in the future. Today’s students will enter a job market where many careers will rely on technology. They’ll need to be able to understand it and mature enough to use it appropriately. After all of the discussion among Ontarians, Doug Ford and the provincial government decided to place a ban on cellphones in classrooms, coming into effect this coming September. There are a number of schools across the country where these restrictions have already been implemented. While I believe that young children don’t need to access social media, I also believe it should be up to individual schools to decide their cellphone policy rather than the government. Disagreeing with every decision the Ford government makes has become a reoccurring trend among some people, especially the Leader of the Official Opposition in Ontario and the leader of the Ontario New Democratic party, Andrea Horwath. People also raised dissenting voices at Ford’s handling of the sex-ed curriculum and for the almost-appointment of personal friend Ron Tanveer as the OPP commissioner. Although some of Doug Ford’s opinions may be unpopular, there are some things worth mentioning in regard to the cellphone ban. Firstly, this isn’t a new announcement; the cellphone ban was originally proposed as part of the PC Party’s election platform. Secondly, the purpose of the ban isn’t to keep students from their phones but to reduce the amount of misuse of cellphones in class. For example, if a student believed their work could better be explained or completed by using their phone that could be allowed. Teachers and school boards may also grant a student access to their phone if they have an accessibility issue. Lastly, after the election last summer the Ford administration and Education Minister Lisa Thompson embarked on a process to collect opinions from the public on matters like the sex-ed curriculum and cellphones through digital surveys and telephone town halls. The information and opinions surrounding the sex-ed curriculum dominated the narrative in the media though both issues are a headache for parents and teachers alike. According to Thompson around 97 percent of respondents agreed with some sort of ban on cellphones. Although the provincial government creates a lot of debate in the media due to their controversial decisions and opinions, a ban on cellphones is a good step. From my point of view, this step by the provincial government should be welcomed without pushback from people like NDP Leader Andrea Horwath.

      "When a lot of business decision-making takes a toll on your mental willpower Jas Darar ▼ | January 14, 2019   Did you know that the average person makes about 35,000 decisions in a day? Sure, most of these decision are small ones — what to eat, where to go, what to wear — but every decision requires energy, and especially when combined with a lot of physical activity, it will eventually drain our mind. It’s what experts call decision fatigue. The higher the number of choices you make throughout the day, the more exhausting each one becomes for your brain. Now when you’re the head of company, those decisions become not only important but could also be detrimental to the fate of the business. Business leaders have a lot of decision-making responsibilities on their plate and sometimes it becomes too much for their mind. When this happens, the brain begins to look for shortcuts in processing certain situations, and that recklessness is not very good when you’ve got an entire company depending on you to make the right calls. Below are several ways to fight decisions fatigue. Make fewer decisions, delegate the rest Just like with any other life problem that results from being excessive, the best way to reduce decision fatigue is to reduce the number of decisions you have to make in a day. And the way to do that is to plan everything that can be planned ahead of time. Decide your meals the night before, so you know what you’re having for breakfast. Pick out your clothes days in advance. Use daily planners and to-do lists. Leverage automation for things that are recurring. Then, you can delegate decisions the same way you delegate tasks. By giving responsibility for decision-making to other people, you reduce the number of decisions on your plate. Making a big decision? Do it in the morning Studies have found that people tend to vary their decision-making guidelines throughout the day. In the morning, they tend to be more careful and meticulous in their choices. But as decision fatigue sets in later in the afternoon and at night, they start making riskier decisions. So if you have a have a big decision that necessitates cautious consideration, schedule to make it in the morning. Make one decision at a time by setting deadlines Sometimes there are several things that require your decision throughout a long project or a certain timeframe, and when these things overlap each other, it could result to poor decision-making on your part. The trick is to space them out by setting mini-deadlines for each stage or process that needs decisions before you can proceed. When you’ve these decisions their respective time for you to focus on, you’re truly using your best judgment. Trust your decisions when you’ve already made them Business owners often have the attitude that everything they do needs to be perfect, and this puts a lot of pressure on them to make the “right” choice, because the “wrong” one could ruin everything. This causes them to second-guess the choices they have made and keeps them from moving along to the next parts of the process. It’s true — every decision is important. But if you become obsessed with every move you make and can barely function anymore because of anxiety, that’s not right anymore. Have faith in the choices you made and instead of worrying whether or not you screwed it up, focus on why your decision was a great one and work on making it work.

      "10 - Is social media marketing worth what it’s costing you?\n",
      "https://lite.poandpo.com/oped/is-social-media-marketing-worth-what-its-costing-you-31122018273/\n",
      "Is social media marketing worth what it’s costing you? Sue Painter ▼ | December 31, 2018   In the past week or so I’ve had about a dozen people in the online world want to talk about the increasing amounts of time they’re putting into social media marketing. I feel it myself – managing my social marketing has come to take a larger portion of my business’s budget along with more of my time and team members’ time. I’m not so sure it’s worth it. It’s very easy to discount your time and the money you spend for social media graphics and posting tools. But it’s important to keep your eyes on these costs and have a sense of whether marketing on social is worth it for your business. So here’s how it’s gone for me – I used to use a few free or inexpensive tools to manage posting content on social media. And in terms of social platforms, I’ve used Facebook primarily. But I’ve cycled through Twitter, Pinterest, LinkedIn and more. I flirted with some of the trendy things back in time – Periscope (which everyone thought would be the hot new thing), and Blab (remember that one?) Then of course, there’s things like Snapchat (not for me), and Instagram, where I am putting a good deal of effort lately. Here’s what I’m seeing as major changes in social media marketing that affect your business and your bottom line. Social posting tools have come and gone, and many of them have seen their capabilities chopped in half by the social platforms. Generally, your social media accounts don’t like you using posting tools to plan and post ahead of time. They are vested in you being “real time” all the time. Just let me say, if you’ve got enough time to spend in real time, every day, on various social media channels, you don’t have a going business. Facebook has enabled scheduled posting for your page and your groups right on their own platform, so it’s dumb to use an outside tool and get less reach than you will get with using their own prescheduling features. You can’t pre-schedule a single thing on your own personal profile on FB anymore, even within Facebook itself. While some people really like that, others of us who would like to keep a presence on our personal profiles once a day or so while we are out of pocket find their new policy restrictive and annoying. New tools come and go, and they are getting pricier. What used to be free or maybe $10 a month now is about $30 a month. And many tools are more expensive than that. But while some of them have cool features, they all focus in a certain way. If you made of list of what you really need for support from these tools, you’d find yourself buying access to multiple tools – and some of them are upwards of $100 a month or more. For me, I can’t possibly product all the graphics that match my content by myself, I’m not a graphic designer and there’s not enough hours in the day. So this year I’ve added a part time graphics person who uses Canva to produce graphics to the content and quotes that I give her – so I’m still doing the content part, she’s just making it pretty. Still, that’s a part time team member and my own time in training her and creating keyword rich content, too. When I decided to really beef up Instagram this year, it was clear I had to have help. In order to gain followers who are truly interested in what you have to say, you have to constantly like their content and chat with them. To build on IG that often means 700 or 800 “likes” a day. So now I have a second new part time team member who helps me with getting that done – but only after I provide the hashtags and people to follow – so I’m still putting in a ton of time and making sure that things are in my voice. I’m creating all the content for Instagram, even though I have some help in scheduling posts and in creating graphics to my content. And, whenever I get a spare moment I of course am commenting and liking on ALL the social media platforms I use. If I’m honest with myself, I’m easily spending double the time I used to spend on social platforms. And there’s an opportunity cost to doing that, for sure! So this year the time and the money I’m throwing at social media marketing has gone from maybe $50 a month to over $300 a month, plus a huge investment of my time. Will it pay off? That’s an open question. Given that the “rules” on various social platforms change almost daily, what I think is a good strategy might not pan out at all. Sometimes, I really think I’m wasting time and money. So here’s what I recommend for you: - Keep track of what you are spending in time and money and team time (which is money). For everything you do, there’s an opportunity cost for what you are NOT doing. You can’t do it all, so it has to count. That means watching your operating costs and not letting the time suck and the money spent get out of hand. - Track where your customers (sales) come from. Track it like a hound dog. ALWAYS pay attention. If you are getting more referrals from word of mouth and from speaking than anything else, feel free to chop out some of your social marketing time and costs. But to make this decision, you need to know where your customers come from. Always, always pay attention to this. Keep a list! - Pick no more than 2 social platforms to work with and put blinders on the others for a while, until you see that these two are actually paying off. - Don’t spend time on social media chatting up the folks who do what you do – use it to find new centers of influence and collaborations for yourself that can be win-wins for you and the person you are reaching out to. In other words, be strategic. - Repurpose your content diligently. Because reach on social platforms is decreasing (unless you are Joanna Gaines) it’s really doubtful that people will see what you are posting and think, “Oh, she just posted that yesterday over on Facebook, and here I’m seeing it again on Instagram.” Like, who cares? If it’s good content, people will like seeing it, and epetition can help you with top of mind awareness.  Make sure that your content on social drives traffic to your website and at least now and then has a call to action. I am absolutely the queen of repurposing. I have trained my 2 team members who help me with this how to slice, dice, and bake solid content at least 8 different ways. If you want to know more about that, stay tuned, and give me a heads up – I’ll do some training on it for you. Bottom line – social media marketing is probably a much bigger expense to you than you realize. Make sure you aren’t glossing over what it’s costing you, and as best you can (it’s impossible to measure cleanly) see if you are getting a return on your investment. Keep your business hat on and don’t let what you are spending on social media marketing get out of hand.

But two of the 30 new reported cases were found about 2 kms (1.2 miles) outside the core zone where other cases were found, the Brandenburg ministry said. Electric fences are being built around the area of the latest finds. ■\n",

      "Grieg Seafood to invest in RAS site that grows salmon to market size on land Christian Fernsby ▼ | January 21, 2021   Grieg Seafood entered joint venture for post-smolt and land-based salmon farming. The joint venture Årdal Aqua will produce at least 3 000 tonnes of post-smolt annually and grow fish all the way to harvest size in a new land-based facility in Rogaland in Southern Norway. Grieg Seafood owns one third of the company. “We are working hard to improve biology and fish welfare, and to reduce our impact. For a long time, we have invested in post-smolt, where we keep the fish longer on land before we release it into the sea, as an important part of the solution. With Årdal Aqua we will be able to develop this farming method further. We aim for all of our fish in Rogaland to spend less than one year in the sea,” says Andreas Kvame, CEO of Grieg Seafood and Chair of Årdal Aqua. The project is currently in the design development phase, and the company aims to start construction during the autumn of 2021. The facility will be built in Årdal in Rogaland, and has a production capacity of 5 000 tonnes annually according to current plans. The company aims to increase the production capacity further. With the current plans, the Årdal Aqua will create 25 local jobs in Rogaland. The company will deliver at least 3 000 tonnes of post-smolt annually to Grieg Seafood’s sea farms in Rogaland. In addition, the company aims to gradually produce fish to harvest size on land. “Through our post-smolt investments we acquire competence on how to produce larger fish on land. Based on this knowledge, Årdal Aqua will also grow fish all the way to harvest size. We will take a step-by-step approach, as we know how complex biology is,” Kvame continues. He is convinced that different farming technologies and methods will complement each other in the future. “With continuous improvements that reduce the impact from our sea farms, something we work a lot on, farming in the seas will still be the main component of the industry going forward. Land-based farming is, however, a great supplement, and we look forward to taking part in the development of this technology. What we know for sure is that the world will need a lot more healthy and nutritious food with the lowest possible impact,” says Kvame. Årdal Aqua is owned one third by Grieg Seafood, one third by the smolt and post-smolt company Vest Havbruk and one third by the Stavanger-based investor group Omfar. The company will release information about the investment cost when the design development phase is completed. It estimates an investment cost of 120 NOK/kg. ■\n",

      "Malaysia files WTO complaint over EU palm oil restriction Christian Fernsby ▼ | January 20, 2021   Malaysia has filed a complaint with the World Trade Organisation (WTO) over European Union rules affecting the consumption of palm oil-based biofuels, according to a document published on Tuesday. In the complaint, dated Jan 15, Malaysia charges that the EU, and in particular its member states France and Lithuania, had imposed restrictive measures on the use of palm oil that violate international trade agreements. Malaysia, the world’s second largest producer of palm oil, baulked at EU efforts to phase out the use of palm oil as a biofuel, and has requested consultations to help resolve the dispute. The EU has embarked on an major plan committing member states to build a carbon neutral economy by 2050, including by promoting the use of biofuels. But it has deemed that palm oil production is not sustainable, and palm oil-based biofuels cannot be counted towards EU renewable targets. By doing so, the bloc and its member states “confer unfair benefits to EU domestic producers of certain biofuel feedstocks, such as rapeseed oil and soy, and the biofuels produced therefrom, at the expense of palm oil and oil palm crop-based biofuels from Malaysia,” according to the complaint. ■\n",

Emergency Action Notifications (EAN) alert trade entities of non-compliance with APHIS regulations. The EAN provides options for phytosanitary actions that must be taken to prevent the entry of plant pests, prohibited plant products, or animal products capable of introducing foreign animal diseases.  CBPAS in Portal found Nysius, commonly known as a false chinch bug, within a shipment of screws from Taiwan. This type of seed bug is a pest that attacks wheat and other grains as well as vegetables. Due to the contamination, the container and contents were returned to Taiwan. During an inspection of a rail container in International Falls, Minnesota, CBPAS intercepted Chloropidae (grass fly) in a shipment of flower pots from China. The grass fly is a pest that feed on the secretions around the eyes and nose of animals and humans.  The grass fly is capable of spreading bacterial infections. The container was safeguarded until the threat could be mitigated. CBPAS in Pembina discovered a shipment of Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) protected plants including Ginseng and Dendrobium. The shipment was manifested as tea. The CITES shipment was missing documentation and is required to enter at specific locations listed on the paperwork. The shipment was returned to Canada.   “These agriculture seizures show the significant priority Customs and Border Protection places on our agriculture inspection program at our ports of entry,” said Pembina Area Port Director Jason Schmelz.  “Preventing harm to domestic crops and vegetation is an important role our Agriculture Specialists provide this country.” ■\n",

      "Panama approves the import of 9,000 quintals of onion for February Christian Fernsby ▼ | January 20, 2021   The onion and potato agri-food chain committee approved the import of 9,000 quintals of onions to cover demand in February 2021. Jorge Igualada, the coordinator of agri-food chains of the Ministry of Agricultural Development (Mida), said the imported onion can not be marketed after February 28, as that is when the bulk of national production enters the market. He also said that, after reviewing the productive areas' production figures, the harvest forecasts, estimating consumption in the current situation, the committee decided to allow imports for February in order to avoid a shortage. Igualada also stressed that the national producers were able to supply the market this year thanks to the adjustments made in the chain and the consensus between importers, marketers, producers, consumers, and members of the National Association of Distributors of Inputs, with the coordination of the Mida. This year, the entire market was supplied with national onions from January to July of this year. In previous years, the country had to import onions between January and March, and sometimes even in April, and that onion competed unfairly with the national onion. The coordinator of the onion and potato chain, Jorge Santamaria, said that the country's onion production has increased by 23% since 2019 thanks to the National Government's work. Santamaria said that the main onion producing areas in the country were the provinces of Los Santos, Herrera, Cocle, and Chiriqui. The country is expected to harvest nearly 28,529 quintals in 69 hectares in February; in March, 64,753 quintals in 128.60 hectares, and in April, 69,303 quintals in 95.99 hectares. 99 producers will participate in this quarter's production this year. ■\n",

This is in recognition of the unique circumstances of the fishing sector, which has had the most significant new requirements to adjust to, and for whom even a short delay can lead to goods perishing - at a time when the industry is facing lower market prices and demand due to the pandemic. The fund will be targeted at fishing export businesses who can evidence a genuine loss in exporting fish and shellfish to the EU. Support will be available immediately and paid retrospectively to cover losses incurred since 1 January 2021. The scheme will be targeted at small and medium enterprises and the maximum claim available to individual operators will be £100,000. The Marine Management Organisation will administer the scheme on behalf of exporters across the UK. More details will be available on eligibility criteria in the coming days.

Dairy farmers will receive, on the basis of their milk quota, cash payments of $468 million in 2020-21, $469 million in 2021-22, and $468 million in 2022-23. In order to receive their payments, producers must register for the program through the Canadian Dairy Commission prior to March 31, 2021. This next step builds on the Minister's announcement on November 28, 2020 to deliver the promised full and fair compensation valued at $1.75 billion to dairy producers for the market access concessions made under the Canada-European Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) and the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) over the course of four years instead of eight. The Government of Canada is also moving forward with consultations with chicken, egg, turkey and hatchery egg sector representatives on the design of the $691-million, 10-year compensation programs, which were also announced by Minister Bibeau in November 2020. Responding to sector demands, these programs will help drive innovation and market development for farmers. Consultations are expected to conclude early this year, and program details will be announced as soon as possible. In August 2019, Minister Bibeau announced that $1.75 billion would be provided to compensate Canadian dairy farmers over eight years. Between December 2019 and January 2020, more than 10,000 dairy farmers received a cash payment of $345 million. The Government has set a schedule to deliver the remaining $1.405 billion through direct payments to farmers over a timeline of only three years.

      "Give employees leadership responsibilities and you'll get more efficient workers Christian Fernsby ▼ | January 18, 2021   Giving employees added responsibilities at work can significantly help their development and even change their personality traits, found a study by the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) Business School. Prof Li carried out the research alongside other seven other academics from Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Rutgers University, University of Florida, the Asia School of Business and Leuphana University of Lueneburg, University of Leeds, as well as a CUHK Business School PhD candidate. They tested their ideas in two studies using publicly available US and Australian databases, which compared the personality development of individuals at different stages over lengthy periods. People were split into a ‘becoming leaders’ group, for employees who were promoted into leadership roles, and a ‘non-leaders’ group” for those staff who remained as employee across time. The research found that moving into leadership roles led to an increase in a person’s “conscientiousness” and found no significant changes in people’s emotional stability. Prof Li said the results of the two studies supported their hypotheses about the relationship between becoming a leader and subsequent impact of performance. “We suggest organisations consider assigning staff with informal leadership roles as a way to encourage them to develop management capabilities,” he said. “This may help them to develop the types of behaviour and traits associated with conscientiousness and prepare them for their future tasks. “We also encourage organisations to broaden the scope and content of training to include personality development and also focus on more holistic forms of leadership development.” “One of the crucial factors in driving adult personality development is taking on new roles at work,” said researcher Wendong Li, Associate Professor at the Department of Management at CUHK. “As they take on wider responsibilities and play more important roles in organisations, novice leaders are expected to be more conscientious than when they were employees – more efficient, organised, vigilant, achievement-oriented, and dependable to subordinates. “Fulfilling the expectations and responsibilities required by leadership roles also means leaders must deal effectively with uncertainties and changes. Therefore, leaders need to be able to remain calm, and handle negative emotions in response to stress.” ■\n",

      "Surprise: Negative reviews boost sales Christian Fernsby ▼ | December 14, 2020   Aleksei Smirnov, Assistant Professor, HSE University Faculty of Economic Sciences, and Egor Starkov, Assistant Professor, University of Copenhagen, have constructed a mathematical model that explains why it is advantageous for sellers not to delete negative reviews of their products. A study detailing this conclusion has been accepted for publication in The American Economic Journal: Microeconomics. Empirical studies have indicated that consumers are more likely to buy a product with a rating slightly below a perfect one rather than a perfect one. Using game theory, the researchers analyzed how negative reviews affect sales. The researchers' model, which they presented in their paper \"Bad News Turned Good: Reversal under Censorship,\" involves two sets of participants: sellers, who know the true quality of the products they are selling and can selectively publish reviews about it, and buyers, who do not know a product's quality and can be categorized as either 'naïve' or 'rational.\" Rational buyers use all available information to determine the quality of a product, while naïve buyers tend to take product reviews at face value and do not make any further inference. \"If there were only naïve consumers in the market, sellers would leave only perfect reviews, because the naïve consumers believe what they read and there is no reason to disenchant them with negative reviews,\" Aleksei Smirnov explains. However, in reality there are both naïve and rational consumers in the market, and the situation is as follows. Good reviews are perceived positively by everyone. Bad reviews are bad for the naïve consumers, but for the rational consumers these reviews actually increase their confidence in the quality of a product. Why? Because, the authors say, every bad review weakens sales among naïve consumers. Therefore, only a seller of a high quality product will be confident enough to publish it—they can be certain that in the future their product will garner positive feedback, and sales among rational consumers will compensate for any losses among naïve consumers. Thus, bad reviews become a positive signal to rational consumers, and, by attracting more rational consumers, sellers boost sales. Examples where a seller is not only not shy about negative feedback but, on the contrary, flaunts it, can be found literally on the street. For example, roadside advertising billboards for digitec, the largest electronics retailer in Switzerland, feature poor customer reviews of their products. The authors of the study do not have data on how this advertising campaign has affected digitec's profits, but given that the billboards have been around for years, it can be assumed that this marketing move has been quite successful. ■\n",

      "An important advice for all leaders out there: Your people don't want just their paycheck Christian Fernsby ▼ | December 7, 2020   If you work in a good advertising agency, you are trained to ask a very important question: “Why should anybody care?” Seriously. Why should anyone care about your beer? Great taste? Less filling? Who knows? Or your car? Is it sexy? Is it priced well? Does it get good gas mileage? Does any of it matter? And so you drill down. You do your homework. You start asking questions. Eventually, if you’re lucky, you’ll get some answers. And then, if you’re lucky, you’ll execute against those answers and watch your ad move the product off the shelf like nobody’s business, Gapingvoid writes. Or not. It’s never certain. It’s never guaranteed. It’s a messy business because life is messy. That being said, if you can figure out the reason the REAL reason why people should give a damn about your widget, you’ve got a shot. You’ve got something to build on. And so it is with leadership. To lead people, you need to know, intellectually and emotionally, why people should follow you. Why they should care. Why it matters. Sure, they want a paycheck. Sure, they want a job. But they want more than that. Granted, they may never be CEO, they may never be millionaire rockstars, but they still want their shot. Their shot at what? Their shot at doing something that matters. Their shot at doing something worth talking about. Their shot at prying their life out of the jaws of mediocrity. And if they don’t get their shot, they’ll go elsewhere to find it. Or if they stick around, well, you wouldn’t want them on your team anyway. The scary thing is, of course, is that when you question why anybody should give a hoot, the answer is “I have no idea”, or “Who the hell knows” or “There’s no reason for them to do so”. And that leaves you up the creek, sans paddle. But that is what real leadership is. Often, the reason to care isn’t obvious. It’s your job to make it so. What is the lesson here? Yes, culture is all about purpose, motivation, and mattering; the way you lead your people is very much about understanding where they are, what they need. Create the throughline on these emotions and you can build a beautiful thing- a place that all of your employees, customers, shareholders, and the media love. ■\n",

      "Simple signs to spot toxic work environment Christian Fernsby ▼ | November 30, 2020   It’s not always easy to spot a toxic work environment but you can spot one if you pay attention to some details.

You know those ads with an arm long job description will everything that fits on paper, and you should ideally be 25 years old with experience that lasts 25 years? Yes, skip that. If the interview has common questions we all know like what's your best side, what are your weaknesses, why do you want to work there blah blah you might go because this shows that those people are unable to make real questions so it's very questionable will they be able to define the job properly. If you reach the interview stage where you can ask questions and you get a vague answer to \"What are the company's core values?\" question, that is a reason for alarm. If they don't know they won't be able to clearly tell you what's expected from you. Then, observe the other side of the table. Are those people colleagues or there is a silence while the boss speaks? If they nod to everything the boss says the chance is you will have to. Are they interested in you or they just conduct an interview because they have to? If they are not interested, it's better to find a place where your prospective employer will treat you better. If the interview is very short and everything is done in minutes, that's not a good sign. When someone want to good employee some time must be spent. So, just \"hello\" and a few simple questions show that is neither a serious job interview nor a serious company. Take a look around and pay attention is the place quiet. If it is then you don't have to come back. That most probably means that there is no collaboration or people are too scared to talk because the boss will yell.

      "A primary task of leadership is to direct attention Christian Fernsby ▼ | November 23, 2020   To do so, leaders must learn to focus their own attention, Daniel Goleman writes. Focusing on yourself, focusing on others, and focusing on the wider picture sheds new light on the practice of many essential leadership skills. Leaders who heed their inner voices can draw on more resources to make better decisions and connect with their authentic selves. Hearing your inner voice is a matter of paying careful attention to internal physiological signals. These subtle cues are monitored by the insula, which is tucked behind the frontal lobes of the brain. Attention given to any part of the body amps up the insula’s sensitivity to that part. Tune in to your heartbeat, and the insula activates more neurons in that circuitry. How well people can sense their heartbeats has, in fact, become a standard way to measure their self awareness. Gut feelings are messages from the insula and the amygdala, which the neuroscientist Antonio Damasio, of the University of Southern California, calls somatic markers. Those messages are sensations that something “feels” right or wrong. Somatic markers simplify decision making by guiding our attention toward better options. The most successful traders (whose annual income averaged £500,000) were neither the ones who relied entirely on analytics nor the ones who just went with their guts. They focused on a full range of emotions, which they used to judge the value of their intuition. When they suffered losses, they acknowledged their anxiety, became more cautious, and took fewer risks. The least successful traders (whose income averaged only £100,000) tended to ignore their anxiety and keep going with their guts. Because they failed to heed a wider array of internal signals, they were misled. The word “attention” comes from the Latin attendere, meaning “to reach toward.” This is a perfect definition of focus on others. Executives who can effectively focus on others are easy to recognize. They are the ones who find common ground, whose opinions carry the most weight, and with whom other people want to work. They emerge as natural leaders regardless of organizational or social rank. People who lack social sensitivity are easy to spot. Social sensitivity appears to be related to cognitive empathy. Cognitively empathic executives do better at overseas assignments, for instance, presumably because they quickly pick up implicit norms and learn the unique mental models of a new culture. Alarmingly, research suggests that as people rise through the ranks and gain power, their ability to perceive and maintain personal connections tends to suffer a sort of psychic attrition. In studying encounters between people of varying status, Dacher Keltner, a psychologist at Berkeley, has found that higher ranking individuals consistently focus their gaze less on lower ranking people and are more likely to interrupt or to monopolize the conversation. Leaders with a strong outward focus are not only good listeners but also good questioners. They are visionaries who can sense the far flung consequences of local decisions and imagine how the choices they make today will play out in the future. They are open to the surprising ways in which seemingly unrelated data can inform their central interests. In an era when almost everyone has access to the same information, new value arises from putting ideas together in novel ways and asking smart questions that open up untapped potential. If people are given a quick view of a photo of lots of dots and asked to guess how many there are, the strong systems thinkers in the group tend to make the best estimates. But in a small but significant number of people, a strong systems awareness is coupled with an empathy deficit a blind spot for what other people are thinking and feeling and for reading social situations. For that reason, although people with a superior systems understanding are organizational assets, they are not necessarily effective leaders. An executive at one bank explained that it has created a separate career ladder for systems analysts so that they can progress in status and salary on the basis of their systems smarts alone. That way, the bank can consult them as needed while recruiting leaders from a different pool one containing people with emotional intelligence. ■\n",

      "Short sellers use customer satisfaction survey data to bet on companies' stock Christian Fernsby ▼ | November 16, 2020   New research coauthored by a Rice University professor of marketing finds that businesses interested in improving their stock prices should focus on improving customer satisfaction. The study, published in the Journal of Marketing Research, analyzed quarterly data from 273 companies over a 10 year period and found that short interest, a measure of short seller activity, is an important indicator of customer satisfaction. \"Our research finds that customers can move a company's stock price by expressing their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with a product or service, such as when they fill out a feedback survey,\" said Vikas Mittal, the J. Hugh Liedtke Professor of Marketing at Rice's Jones Graduate School of Business. \"Professional investors or short sellers use customer satisfaction survey data to bet on companies' stock,\" he said. \"When customers are dissatisfied with a company, short sellers bet against the company, which drives down a company's stock price. Short sellers avoid betting against a company with satisfied customers, and this increases the company's stock price,\" he said. Consumers give negative experiences more weight than positive experiences, wrote Mittal and co-authors Ashwin Malshe, an assistant professor of marketing at the University of Texas at San Antonio, and Anatoli Colicev, an assistant professor of marketing at Bocconi University in Milan. They also found that dissatisfaction is more than twice as a strong a driver of stock prices as satisfaction. \"A one-unit increase in customer satisfaction is associated with a .56 percentage point increase in abnormal stock returns, while a one-unit increase in customer dissatisfaction is associated with a 1.34 percentage point decrease in abnormal stock returns,\" according to the study. The authors argue that short sellers therefore act as a conduit between customers and stock returns, as investors monitor short selling activity when making decisions. \"The results are the first demonstration showing how customers affect board room decisions, and dissatisfied customers are a key source of stock price declines\" Mittal said. \"Many firms base executive compensation on improving customer satisfaction. Our results show that companies should also base executive compensation on reducing customer dissatisfaction, as we've learned reducing customer dissatisfaction is not the mirror opposite of increasing customer satisfaction.\" \"Potentially, our results provide a very persuasive argument to board members of public companies aiming to maintain and increase investments in customer satisfaction,\" according to the paper. ■\n",

      "CEOs feel the need to take a political stand to contribute to society Christian Fernsby ▼ | November 9, 2020   Political and social engagement is a relevant topic for European business leaders. CEOs are increasingly making public statements on political issues in order to make a positive contribution to socially relevant topics. These are the findings of a recent study conducted by ESMT Master's in Management graduate Christoph Cewe in cooperation with United Europe e.V. The study surveyed leaders of large European companies. Of those surveyed, 77.5 per cent believe that managing directors should take a stand on political issues, and 62.5 per cent state that they are also (very) likely to express themselves in sociopolitical terms. The most frequently reported motives for taking a public stance are to contribute to society (78%) and to express corporate values (72%). The study entitled \"The political CEO: Rationales behind CEO sociopolitical activism\" explores the question of how and why CEOs and managing directors of European companies increasingly take a public stance on political and social issues that have no direct connection to their core business. Examples are climate change, immigration policy and the unconditional basic income. \"The results of the study show that managing directors express themselves publicly, primarily on political issues, so that they can use their influence to make a positive contribution on socially relevant topics. Personal motives and potential advantages for shareholders do not play a greater role,\" says Christoph Cewe. European CEOs want to add value to the substantive discourse with their public statement, but do not want to take a party political stance. Thus, ecological, economic and social issues are identified as the most suitable topics for public comment. Less than one in ten of the CEOs surveyed stated that it is appropriate to take a party political stance in public. Leonhard Birnbaum, member of the board of management of E.ON SE, Günther H.

      "Why do negotiations fail? Maybe you think about yourself too much Ted Blackwater ▼ | November 2, 2020   To be a good negotiator is not easy. You have to have a lot of experience and knowledge but maybe the most important advice would be to think about the other side more, and leave your ego behind if you want success. To negotiate something in your favor you have to use a range of tactics, depending on a situation and the goal you want to achieve. Be it a kid that doesn't want to eat her lunch or a huge business deal, it all comes down to one thing: you want something. So, in the first place, you are thinking about your own interest and then comes everything else. And that's normal, that is the very reason you are going into negotiations in the first place. But, surprisingly, that may lead to a fail. Let's see some common reasons why negotiations fail and what is behind it. It may come as a surprise but the first reason could be too much talk. You might think that you have to elaborate everything and more about your position to make the other side understand your reasons and agree to a deal. But if you talk too much you won't get what you want. Being lost in your own talk it's easy to forget the main objective goal of any negotiation: to make both parties satisfied. So, if you don't allow the other side to talk and bring forward their stand and reasons, you will achieve an unwanted goal: people will see you as an egocentric person who doesn't care about others. And they would be right. You won't give them a chance to bring their argument and you won't see why they came to a negotiating table and what they want. You will be seen as \"only me person\" and you will go home without a deal. The next mistake would be to hide your feelings altogether. You might think that you can negotiate avoiding emotive language because emotions will show what you really want. That has bad consequences and they are easy to see. If you do that you may lose clarity. Business is not just about numbers but also about people and workers and employees and profit and human relations. So, everything is important.  If you don't show any emotions the other side will think that you don't care about them too and that would be true. And it's not easy to negotiate with a robot so people will show you the door. Sharing your feelings is a powerful thing so don't think that hiding them will show your strength, it will show just one thing and that's that you are thinking about yourself and nothing else. Another mistake would be to offer a counter proposal on every offer the other side makes. There are a million things that make a successful business cooperation and if you make a counter offer on every one of them, the conclusion is so easy: you are thinking about yourself only. A successful negotiator makes half the counter offers than an unsuccessful one. That's a rule of thumb but it is a very important thing to remember. When negotiating, you must have a stand to protect your business but you must also allow the other side to get something good from your relationship. So, if you are making counter offers after every sentence you will be very annoying but what's even most important is that you will show that you don't list the other side. It is impossible that you have an objection on everything the other side proposes, that's simply impossible. All those examples and mistakes show one thing: although we should think about ourselves first, we must also think about the other side. The thing is, we are genetically wired to think about ourselves in every situation because our life depends on it: if our business fails we may be without work and that means without bread on the table. So, being egocentric to a degree is good but there is a catch. Humans are social beings and we learn through ages that we may achieve a lot more if we work together. If you lose on one side, you will see a gain on another. If you lose a few percentages here, you will get more products there. If you lower your prices, you may sell more products. You can always let something go to get something else. So, it is good to think about yourself but not only about yourself. That's true for life and that's true for business. Because there are other people out there who think about you too.  ■\n",

      "https://lite.poandpo.com/leadership/redefine-your-culture-for-virtual-workplace/\n",
      "Redefine your culture for virtual workplace Christian Fernsby ▼ | October 26, 2020   With more Americans working remotely than ever before, some organizations are scrambling to craft a 'virtual culture' in an effort to maintain performance in the 'new normal' and to prepare for the 'next normal. It's through the employee experience that organizations can sustain that culture, regardless of where an employee may work. And by focusing on creating the virtual and hybrid employee experience, organizations will empower and inspire all employees to do their best work. This new normal presents organizations with an opportunity to redefine the behaviors and rituals that codify the cultural values leadership wants to be reflected across the employee experience. Doing so is wise, given that the employee experience has a direct impact on customers' experiences and a company's recruitment and retention potential. Simply stated, if your culture functioned well in a traditional workplace, stay consistent. You need one culture, whether employees are remote or in-office, that supports what your organization values. Employees' partnerships, experiences with their managers, and roles need to feel the same, whether they're in or out of the office. Gallup studies indicate that organizations are most effective at creating a shared culture when they: Align the virtual, hybrid and in-person employee experience with workplace culture. Identify moments that matter in each mode of work. Create the change that's necessary for a shared culture. Align the experience with workplace culture Reflect on how you want your organization's distinctive purpose, brand and culture to be applied differently in the new environment. Redefine the behaviors and rituals that codify cultural values and make sure these are reflected across the employee experience. For example, a Gallup client that was accustomed to shuffling employees from city to city for in-person meetings was delighted to find that remote meetings gave them the human connection they were looking for and saved time while promoting wellbeing. At face value, limiting travel for employees might seem like a counterculture move, even during a pandemic. However, this client's core values guided them to adjust how they communicate. Identify moments that matter Different moments in the employee experience are more crucial than others, depending on dynamic factors including the employee value proposition, the individual role and the job market. Consider onboarding, for example: If new employees in a hot job market find that the tenor of the organization changes quickly after they're hired, companies may see spikes in early-employee turnover. Additionally, the organization scheduled daily social interactions with new colleagues and mentors for the new hires so they could develop key relationships a critical component of successful onboarding and doubled down on connecting new hires to the organization's purpose. Create the change Use your organizational identity (i.e., the culmination of your purpose, brand and culture) to affirm your expectations about how work gets done across the spectrum of work virtual to in-person. Think through the ways you provide stability and vision around culture. Identify and encourage manager actions that positively affect employees' experiences at work. For example, Gallup's research reveals that when managers give feedback a few times per week to remote workers, the engagement levels of those employees exceed both fully on-site and partially remote workers who receive the same frequency of feedback. An organization's core values and identity should guide decisions about the employee experience. ■\n",

      "https://lite.poandpo.com/leadership/startups-should-think-like-camels/\n",
      "Startups should think like camels Christian Fernsby ▼ | October 19, 2020   In Silicon Valley the predominant model is to raise unicorns, startups worth over a billion dollars. Traditionally, this is done through rapid growth, Alex Lazarow writes for Harvard Business Review. \"The problem now, however, is that this growth-at-all-costs methodology, which the Valley’s top players are exceptionally good at, only works in the strongest bull markets, in the most optimal conditions. \"But consider what I call the Frontier: those business ecosystems outside the Bay Area bubble, where startups have less access to capital or trained startup human capital, and where, especially in many emerging markets, they are more susceptible to severe and unpredictable macroeconomic shocks. \"Instead of the unicorn, the camel is the more fitting mascot. \"Camels are able to survive for long periods without sustenance, withstand the scorching desert heat, and adapt to extreme variations in climate. \"They survive and thrive in some of Earth’s harshest regions. \"These startup camels offer businesses in all industries and sectors valuable lessons on how to survive through crisis, and to sustain and grow in adverse conditions, even if the metaphor isn’t as flashy. \"They do this with three strategies: they execute balanced growth, they take a long-term outlook, and they weave diversification into the business model. \"Camels have no interest in “blitzscaling”, rapidly building-up the enterprise and prioritizing speed over efficiency in pursuit of massive scale. \"They are as ambitious to grow as any Silicon Valley enterprise, yet they take a more balanced growth path. \"This balanced approach has three key elements. \"Camels understand that price shouldn’t be considered a barrier to growth. \"Instead it is a feature of the product that reflects its market position and its quality. \"Camels manage costs through the life cycle of their companies to align with a longer term growth curve. \"Managing burn throughout the life cycle of a company prepares startups to weather tough conditions over a sustained period. \"The typical Silicon Valley startup has a cash trajectory with a deep “valley of death” the graph line reflecting steep losses before profitability is achieved. \"The line for Frontier startups looks different. \"Of course camels don’t avoid growth or venture capital funding, but their scaling trajectory and associated burn rates will be less extreme. \"In some cases, as with Grubhub, they’ll grow in controlled spurts, choosing only to put their foot on the gas and invest (often by raising venture capital) when required by the opportunity at hand. \"Founders at the Frontier understand that building a company is not a short term endeavor.\" For many, breakthroughs don’t come immediately, but rather occur later in the company timeline. Survival is often the primary strategy. This allows time to build the business model, find a product that resonates with the market, and develop an operation that can scale. Competition will exist. But the race is about who will survive the longest, not about who goes to market first. ■\n",

      "Indonesian company PT Bukit Muria Jaya admits to deceiving U.S. banks to trade with North Korea Christian Fernsby ▼ | January 19, 2021   A global supplier of cigarette paper products, PT Bukit Muria Jaya (“BMJ”), has agreed to pay a fine of $1,561,570 and enter into a deferred prosecution agreement with the Justice Department for conspiring to commit bank fraud in connection with the shipment of products to North Korean customers. BMJ, which is incorporated in Indonesia, has also entered into a settlement agreement with the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”). In entering the deferred prosecution agreement, BMJ admitted and accepted responsibility for its criminal conduct and agreed to pay a fine commensurate with the offense.  BMJ agreed to implement a compliance program designed to prevent and detect violations of U.S. sanctions laws and regulations and to regularly report to the Justice Department on the implementation of that program. BMJ also committed to report violations of relevant U.S. laws to the Justice Department and to cooperate in the investigation of such offenses. Pursuant to the agreed statement of facts adopted in the deferred prosecution agreement, BMJ admitted in part that it sold products to two North Korean companies as well as a Chinese trading company while knowing that those products were destined for North Korea.  At the time, U.S. sanctions on North Korea prevented, among other things, correspondent banks in the United States from processing wire transfers on behalf of customers located in North Korea.  After learning that one of its North Korean customers was having difficulty executing payments to BMJ, BMJ personnel agreed to accept payments from third parties that were otherwise unrelated to the transactions. Accepting these third-party payments evaded the sanctions monitoring and compliance systems of U.S. banks, inducing them into executing prohibited transactions. Assuming BMJ’s continued compliance with the deferred prosecution agreement, the government has agreed to defer prosecution for a period of 18 months, after which time, the government would seek to dismiss the charges. ■\n",

The companies concerned are MeierGuss Sales & Logistics GmbH & Co. KG, based in Rahden, and Hydrotec Technologies AG in Wildeshausen. According to the Bundeskartellamt’s investigations, an agreement between the representatives of the two parties had existed at least from 16 May 2018 until the dawn raid that was conducted on 14 November 2018, under which the special rebate for specific standard products (referred to as “second rebate”) and the net prices for specific concrete/iron manhole covers applicable to major customers were to be agreed between the two companies. Based on this agreement the conditions were readjusted several times during the period mentioned above. Senior staff members of MeierGuss and Hydrotec also agreed in mid-August of 2018 to split order enquiries received from two large building material merchants between them. The enquiries concerned deliveries for September and October 2018. In setting the fine the Bundeskartellamt took into account that Hydrotec had cooperated extensively with the Bundeskartellamt in uncovering the agreements and that a settlement could be reached. In accordance with the authority’s leniency programme, no fine was imposed on the company with regard to the agreement to split the two orders. With the exception of the agreement to split the two orders, MeierGuss also acknowledged the facts as established by the Bundeskartellamt and agreed to a settlement.

The Court did not reduce the fine imposed on the company by the Lithuanian competition authority. The Court confirmed a lower court judgment adopted in October 2020, according to which the fine imposed on Sypra was set and imposed properly by Konkurencijos taryba, therefore, the company’s request to reduce the fine was rejected. Since the Court’s ruling is final and binding, the German company will have to pay EUR 27,100 to the Lithuanian budget. In 2018 both courts upheld the decision of Konkurencijos taryba which found that UAB Norvesta and the German company Sypra concluded a cartel agreement which resulted in sanctions. However, the Court sent the case back to Vilnius Regional Administrative Court to decide whether the size of the fine was set properly. Konkurencijos taryba found that both firms coordinated their actions by agreeing in advance that Sypra will submit a bid of more than EUR 1.5 million and Norvesta will not bid higher therefore allowing Sypra to win the auction. Besides, Sypra helped Norvesta to make an agreement with the company engaged in radioactive waste recycling, which was one of the necessary conditions of the participation in the auction. For the infringement of the Law on Competition the companies were fined EUR 27,500 and EUR 27,100 respectively. ■\n",

Slatery III, along with the attorneys general of 27 states, has entered into a settlement with Sabre Corporation that resolves an investigation into the 2017 data breach of Sabre Hospitality Solutions’ hotel booking system. The breach exposed the data of approximately 1.3 million credit cards. The settlement requires a payment of $2.4 million, of which the State of Tennessee will receive $61,909.08 and injunctive relief. Sabre Hospitality Solutions, a business segment of Sabre, operates the SynXis Central Reservation system, which facilitates the booking of hotel reservations. SynXis connects business travel coordinators, travel agencies, and online travel booking companies to Sabre’s hotel customers. On June 6, 2017, Sabre informed its hotel customers of a data breach that occurred between August 2016 and March 2017, which the business had disclosed in a 10-Q SEC filing the month before. The hotels, which were responsible for informing their customers of the breach, did not issue some notifications until 2018. “When a data breach occurs, everyone down the line should be informed immediately,” said General Slatery. “This settlement seeks to protect both consumers and the customers who have provided sensitive information to a third-party vendor.” The settlement requires Sabre to include language in future contracts that specifies the roles and responsibilities of both parties in the event of a breach. It also requires Sabre to try to determine whether its customers have provided notice to consumers, and to provide the attorneys general a list of all the customers that it has notified. In addition, the settlement requires that Sabre implement and maintain a comprehensive information security program, implement a written incident response and data breach notification plan, implement specific security requirements, and undergo a third-party security assessment.

      "https://lite.poandpo.com/crime/toyota-motor-company-to-pay-180-million-for-decadelong-noncompliance-with-clean-air-act-reporting/\n",
      "Toyota Motor Company to pay $180 million for decade-long noncompliance with Clean Air Act reporting Christian Fernsby ▼ | January 15, 2021   The United States has filed and simultaneously settled a civil lawsuit against Toyota Motor Corporation, Toyota Motor North America Inc., Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. Inc., and Toyota Motor Engineering & Manufacturing North America Inc. (Toyota) for systematic, longstanding violations of Clean Air Act emission-related defect reporting requirements, which require manufacturers to report potential defects and recalls affecting vehicle components designed to control emissions. Along with the civil complaint, the United States has filed a consent decree, agreed to by Toyota, that resolves the government’s complaint through Toyota’s payment of a $180 million civil penalty and the imposition of injunctive relief.  The $180 million penalty is the largest civil penalty for violation of EPA’s emission-reporting requirements. The injunctive provisions require Toyota to follow compliance and reporting practices designed to ensure timely investigation of emission-related defects and timely reporting to EPA, and include training, communication, and oversight requirements. “For a decade, Toyota systematically violated regulations that provide EPA with a critical compliance tool to ensure that vehicles on the road comply with federal emissions standards,” said Audrey Strauss, Acting U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. “Toyota shut its eyes to the noncompliance, failing to provide proper training, attention, and oversight to its Clean Air Act reporting obligations. Toyota’s actions undermined EPA’s self-disclosure system and likely led to delayed or avoided emission-related recalls, resulting in financial benefit to Toyota and excess emissions of air pollutants. Today, Toyota pays the price for its misconduct with a $180 million civil penalty and agreement to injunctive relief to ensure that its violations will not be repeated.” During the period of noncompliance, Toyota managers and staff in Japan knew that Toyota was no longer even attempting to determine whether it was aware of 25 instances of the same emission-related defect in a model year – the threshold requirement for filing an EDIR. Rather than follow this legally required standard, Toyota unilaterally decided to file EDIRs principally when Toyota was required to file distinct reports with California regulators under a less strict standard – a standard that EPA had rejected as too lenient when Toyota had previously proposed to rely on it for federal reporting. Toyota managers and staff in Japan repeatedly identified the discrepancy between Toyota’s procedures and the plain language of the federal requirements but failed to bring Toyota into compliance. As a result of its conduct, Toyota deprived EPA of timely information regarding emission-related defects and recalls and avoided the early focus on emission defects contemplated by the regulations. Toyota’s conduct likely resulted in delayed or avoided recalls, with Toyota obtaining a significant economic benefit, pushing costs onto consumers, and lengthening the time that unrepaired vehicles with emission-related defects remained on the road. Toyota admits, acknowledges, and accepts responsibility for what is included in the consent decree. Between approximately 2005 and late 2015, Toyota routinely filed emission defect reports to EPA materially late and, in many cases, failed to file such reports at all until a self-disclosure of non-compliance in late 2015. In March and May 2002, at EPA’s request, Toyota and EPA representatives met to discuss Toyota’s internal process for identifying whether 25 instances of a specific emission-related defect exist in vehicles or engines of the same model year, requiring an EDIR filing. At a first meeting in March 2002, Toyota described its EDIR process in which Toyota would investigate whether it had 25 defects only upon receiving 25 “product reports” from its dealers, but would supplement that review by filing an EDIR upon receiving warranty claims for an emission-related part in 4 percent of Toyota’s California fleet (a threshold requiring a separate filing to state authorities under California law). At the meeting, EPA rejected this EDIR process as not timely considering warranty claims, despite the incorporation of the 4 percent California trigger. At a May 2002 meeting with EPA, Toyota presented its revised process. Under that process, Toyota would commence an investigation to determine whether an EDIR filing was required when it had received warranty claims for an emission-related part for 1 percent of relevant vehicles nationwide; when it received 500 such warranty claims regardless of the percentage; or when it received 25 similar early warning reports. Toyota noted internally that EPA seemed pleased with this approach, which EPA had described as “more stringent than California.” In 2003, 2004, and 2005, as part of an annual review, Toyota submitted its May 2002 process in writing to EPA as an overview of its EDIR reporting program. Without notifying EPA, in approximately 2005, Toyota stopped following the May 2002 EDIR process. In approximately 2005, Toyota began filing EDIRs primarily when filing the California reports triggered by the 4 percent threshold. Toyota also filed EDIRs in a small number of instances when it was otherwise filing VERRs with EPA. From approximately 2005 to 2015, Toyota stopped making any independent determination of whether 25 defects existed requiring an EDIR filing. Multiple times during this period, Toyota staff charged with preparing EDIRs identified that the plain language of the EDIR regulations called for filing an EDIR upon the identification of 25 defects, but that Toyota was not doing so. These staff did not cause Toyota to change its practice. As a result of this conduct, Toyota filed at least 69 EDIRs materially late. Thirty-nine of these were filed materially late in the ordinary course of Toyota’s business. In late 2015, Toyota self-disclosed another 30 that had not been filed at all. Some EDIRs were ultimately filed as many as eight years after they were due. Beyond EDIRs, Toyota also failed during this period to file 20 VERRs required for emission-related recall campaigns that it conducted and failed to file more than two hundred Quarterly Reports related to such campaigns. Between 2005 and 2015, Toyota failed to provide its employees with adequate training, resources, or oversight to ensure that Toyota complied with its reporting obligations to EPA. As a result of Toyota’s conduct, EPA did not timely receive mandated information regarding emission-related defects and recalls. ■\n",

      "Deutsche Bank agrees to pay over $130 million to resolve Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, fraud case Christian Fernsby ▼ | January 10, 2021   Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft (Deutsche Bank or the Company) has agreed to pay more than $130 million to resolve the government’s investigation into violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and a separate investigation into a commodities fraud scheme. The resolution includes criminal penalties of $85,186,206, criminal disgorgement of $681,480, victim compensation payments of $1,223,738, and $43,329,622 to be paid to the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission in a coordinated resolution. Deutsche Bank is a multi-national financial services company headquartered in Frankfurt, Germany. The charges arise out of a scheme to conceal corrupt payments and bribes made to third-party intermediaries by falsely recording them on Deutsche Bank’s books and records, as well as related internal accounting control violations, and a separate scheme to engage in fraudulent and manipulative commodities trading practices involving publicly-traded precious metals futures contracts.  Deutsche Bank entered into a three-year deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section (MLARS) and with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York. The criminal information was filed in the Eastern District of New York charging Deutsche Bank with one count of conspiracy to violate the books and records and internal accounting controls provisions of the FCPA and one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud affecting a financial institution in relation to the commodities conduct. “Deutsche Bank engaged in a seven-year course of conduct, during which it failed to implement a system of internal accounting controls regarding the use of company funds and falsified its books and records to conceal corrupt and improper payments,” said Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Robert Zink of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “Separately, Deutsche Bank traders on three continents sought to manipulate our public financial markets through fraud for five years. This resolution exemplifies the department’s commitment to help ensure that publicly traded companies devise and implement appropriate and proper systems of internal accounting controls and maintain accurate and truthful corporate documentation. It also stands as an example of the department’s efforts to police the public U.S. markets so that all may continue to trust, and rely upon, the integrity of our public financial systems.” “Deutsche Bank engaged in a criminal scheme to conceal payments to so-called consultants worldwide who served as conduits for bribes to foreign officials and others so that they could unfairly obtain and retain lucrative business projects,” stated Acting U.S. Attorney Seth D. DuCharme of the Eastern District of New York. “This office will continue to hold responsible financial institutions that operate in the United States and engage in practices to facilitate criminal activity in order to increase their bottom line.” “The U.S. Postal Inspection Service takes pride in investigating complex fraud and corruption cases that impact American investors,” said Inspector in Charge Delany De Léon-Colón of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service’s Criminal Investigations Group. “This type of deceptive activity can cause immeasurable economic losses to competitive markets around the world. The combined efforts of our partners at the FBI and Department of Justice helped to bring today’s significant action which illustrates our efforts to protect the United States and the international marketplace.” According to admissions and court documents, between 2009 and 2016, Deutsche Bank, acting through its employees and agents, including managing directors and high-level regional executives, knowingly and willfully conspired to maintain false books, records, and accounts to conceal, among other things, payments to a business development consultant (BDC) who was acting as a proxy for a foreign official and payments to a BDC that were actually bribes paid to a decisionmaker for a client in order to obtain lucrative business for the bank. In some instances, Deutsche Bank made payments to BDCs that were not supported by invoices or evidence of any services provided. In other cases, Deutsche Bank employees created or helped BDC’s create false justifications for payments.       In relation to a Saudi BDC, Deutsche Bank admitted that its employees conspired to contract with a company owned by the wife of a client decisionmaker to facilitate bribe payments of over $1 million to the decisionmaker. Deutsche Bank approved the BDC relationship despite Deutsche Bank employees knowing about the relationship between the Saudi BDC and the decisionmaker, and approved the corrupt payments despite Deutsche Bank employees openly discussing the need to pay the Saudi BDC in order to incentivize her husband to continue to do business with Deutsche Bank. In requesting approval of one payment, Deutsche Bank employees cautioned that the “client and [the Saudi BDC] are intimately linked and . . . any cessation of payment to the [the Saudi BDC] will certainly prompt a significant outflow of [business]” from the client. Deutsche Bank also contracted with an Abu Dhabi BDC to obtain a lucrative transaction, despite Deutsche Bank employees knowing that the Abu Dhabi BDC lacked qualifications as a BDC, other than his family relationship with the client decisionmaker, and that the Abu Dhabi BDC was in fact acting as proxy for the client decisionmaker. Deutsche Bank paid the Abu Dhabi BDC over $3 million without invoices. By agreeing to misrepresent the purpose of payments to BDCs and falsely characterizing payments to others as payments to BDCs, Deutsche Bank employees conspired to falsify Deutsche Bank’s books, records, and accounts, in violation of the FCPA. Additionally, Deutsche Bank employees knowingly and willfully conspired to fail to implement internal accounting controls in violation of the FCPA by, among other things, failing to conduct meaningful due diligence regarding BDCs, making payments to certain BDCs who were not under contract with Deutsche Bank at the time, and making payments to certain BDCs without invoices or adequate documentation of the services purportedly performed. Deutsche Bank will pay a total criminal penalty of $79,561,206 in relation to the FCPA scheme. In a related matter with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission, Deutsche Bank will also pay $43,329,622 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest. According to admissions and court documents, between 2008 and 2013, Deutsche Bank precious metals traders engaged in a scheme to defraud other traders on the New York Mercantile Exchange Inc. and Commodity Exchange Inc., which are commodities exchanges operated by the CME Group Inc. On numerous occasions, traders on Deutsche Bank’s precious metals desk in New York, Singapore, and London placed orders to buy and sell precious metals futures contracts with the intent to cancel those orders before execution, including in an attempt to profit by deceiving other market participants through injecting false and misleading information concerning the existence of genuine supply and demand for precious metals futures contracts. On Sept. 25, 2020, a Chicago federal jury found two former Deutsche Bank precious metals traders, James Vorley, 42, of the United Kingdom, and Cedric Chanu, 40, of France and the United Arab Emirates, guilty of wire fraud affecting a financial institution for their respective roles in the commodities scheme. A third former Deutsche Bank trader, David Liew, 35, of Singapore, pleaded guilty on June 1, 2017, to conspiracy to commit wire fraud affecting a financial institution and spoofing. A fourth former Deutsche Bank trader, Edward Bases, 58, of New Canaan, Connecticut, was charged in a third superseding indictment on Nov. 12, 2020, and awaits trial on fraud and conspiracy charges. An indictment is merely an allegation and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law. Deutsche Bank has agreed to pay a total criminal amount of $7,530,218 in relation to the commodities scheme. This amount includes criminal disgorgement of $681,480, victim compensation payments of $1,223,738, and a criminal penalty of $5,625,000, which will be fully credited against Deutsche Bank’s payment of a civil monetary penalty of $30 million to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission in January 2018 in connection with substantially the same commodities conduct. The department reached this resolution with Deutsche Bank based on a number of factors, including the Company’s failure to voluntarily disclose the conduct to the department and the nature and seriousness of the offense, which included corrupt payments, willful violations of the FCPA accounting provisions, and commodities trading violations in three countries. Deutsche Bank received full credit for its cooperation with the department’s investigations and for its significant remediation. Penalties associated with both the FCPA and wire fraud conspiracies reflect a discount of 25 percent off the middle of the otherwise-applicable U.S. Sentencing Guidelines fine range, to account for Deutsche Bank’s 2015 resolution in connection with its manipulation of the London Interbank Offered Rate.   The FCPA investigation is being conducted by the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, and is being prosecuted by the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York. Trial Attorneys Katherine Nielsen, Elizabeth S. Boison and Nikhila Raj, and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Alixandra Smith and Whitman Knapp. The Justice Department’s Office of International Affairs provided assistance in this case. The commodities case is being investigated by the FBI’s New York Field Office, and is being prosecuted by the Fraud Section. Deputy Chief Brian R. Young, Assistant Chief Avi Perry, and Trial Attorney Leslie S. Garthwaite of the Fraud Section are prosecuting the case. ■\n",

      "Russian hacker who helped in attacks on American companies sentenced to 12 years in prison Christian Fernsby ▼ | January 8, 2021   Audrey Strauss, the Acting United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced yesterday that Andrei Tyurin, a/k/a “Andrei Tiurin,” was sentenced in Manhattan federal court to 144 months in prison for computer intrusion, wire fraud, bank fraud, and illegal online gambling offenses in connection with his involvement in a massive computer hacking campaign targeting U.S. financial institutions, brokerage firms, financial news publishers, and other American companies. Tyurin is charged with committing these crimes with Gery Shalon, a/k/a “Garri Shalelashvili,” a/k/a “Gabriel,” a/k/a “Gabi,” a/k/a “Phillipe Mousset,” a/k/a “Christopher Engeham,” Joshua Samuel Aaron, a/k/a “Mike Shields,” and Ziv Orenstein, a/k/a “Aviv Stein,” a/k/a “John Avery,” in furtherance of securities market manipulation, illegal online gambling, and payment processing fraud schemes perpetrated by Shalon, Aaron, Orenstein, and their co-conspirators. Tyurin previously pled guilty to these charges, and was sentenced yesterday before U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain. Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: “From his home in Moscow, Andrei Tyurin played a major role in orchestrating and facilitating an international hacking campaign that included one of the largest thefts of U.S. customer data from a single financial institution in history, stealing the personal information of more than 80 million J.P. Morgan Chase customers. \"The conspiracy targeted major financial institutions, brokerage firms, news agencies, and other companies, and netted Tyurin over $19 million in criminal proceeds. \"Now Tyurin has been sentenced to 12 years in prison for his crimes.” According to the allegations contained in the Indictments to which Tyurin pled guilty, other filings in this case, and statements made during court proceedings, including Tyurin’s guilty plea hearing: From approximately 2012 to mid-2015, Tyurin engaged in an extensive computer hacking campaign targeting financial institutions, brokerage firms, and financial news publishers in the U.S. (including but not limited to J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, E*Trade, Scottrade, and the Wall Street Journal), and was responsible for the theft of personal information of over 100 million customers of the victim companies. Tyurin’s hack of J.P. Morgan Chase Bank alone resulted in the theft of personal information of over 80 million customers.  Tyurin engaged in these crimes at the direction of his partner Gery Shalon, and in furtherance of other criminal schemes overseen and operated by Shalon and his co-conspirators, including securities fraud schemes in the United States.  For example, in an effort to artificially inflate the price of certain stocks publicly traded in the U.S., Shalon and his co-conspirators marketed the stocks in a deceptive and misleading manner to customers of the victim companies whose contact information Tyurin stole in the intrusions. In addition to the U.S. financial sector hacks, from approximately 2007 to mid-2015 Tyurin also conducted cyberattacks against numerous U.S. and foreign companies in furtherance of various criminal enterprises operated by Shalon and his co-conspirators, including unlawful internet gambling businesses and international payment processors.  Nearly all of these illegal businesses, like the securities market manipulation schemes, exploited the fruits of Tyurin’s computer hacking campaigns.  Tyurin’s hacking activity included the targeting of companies known to be used for email marketing campaigns, competitor online casinos, and a merchant risk intelligence firm based in the United States, in order for the co-conspirators to monitor the firm’s efforts to audit potentially criminal online credit card transactions on behalf of major credit card networks, and thus avoid detection of their own criminal schemes. In furtherance of his hacking activities, Tyurin used computer infrastructure located across five continents, which he controlled from his home in Moscow, and maintained persistent access over extended periods of time to the victims’ networks, regularly refreshing the stolen data by repeatedly downloading information from these companies.  And once his hacking activities were detected, Tyurin worked with Shalon to destroy the evidence of their criminal activity and undermine U.S. law enforcement’s efforts to identify and arrest them. Through these various criminal schemes, Tyurin, Shalon, and their co-conspirators obtained hundreds of millions of dollars in illicit proceeds, and Tyurin himself earned over $19 million in profits from his hacking activity. Tyurin, 37, of Moscow, Russia, pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit computer hacking, one count of wire fraud, one count of conspiracy to violate the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act, and one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud.  In addition, Tyurin pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and one count of conspiracy to commit computer hacking, from charges that were transferred from the Northern District of Georgia for purposes of his plea.  In addition to the prison term, Judge Swain ordered Tyurin to serve three years of supervised release, and to pay forfeiture in the amount of $19,214,956. The Court will determine Tyurin’s restitution obligations at a hearing scheduled for April 6, 2021.  Tyurin has been in U.S. custody since he was extradited from the country of Georgia in September 2018, and will commence serving his sentence immediately. Ms. Strauss praised the investigative work of the FBI and the U.S. Secret Service, and expressed her sincere gratitude to the Chief Prosecutor’s Office of Georgia and the Ministry of Justice of Georgia for their support and assistance with the extradition proceedings.  She also thanked the Securities and Exchange Commission, Homeland Security Investigations, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Office of International Affairs of the U.S. Department of Justice’s Criminal Division for its assistance with the extradition, and the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center, which significantly aided the investigation by facilitating information sharing among the victim institutions. The prosecution of this case is being overseen by the Office’s Complex Frauds and Cybercrime Unit.  Assistant U.S. Attorneys Eun Young Choi, Noah Solowiejczyk, and Sarah Lai are in charge of the prosecution. ■\n",

      "Boeing charged with 737 MAX fraud conspiracy and agrees to pay over $2.5 billion Christian Fernsby ▼ | January 8, 2021   The Boeing Company has entered into an agreement with the Department of Justice to resolve a criminal charge related to a conspiracy to defraud the Federal Aviation Administration’s Aircraft Evaluation Group (FAA AEG) in connection with the FAA AEG’s evaluation of Boeing’s 737 MAX airplane. The criminal information charges the company with one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States. Under the terms of the DPA, Boeing will pay a total criminal monetary amount of over $2.5 billion, composed of a criminal monetary penalty of $243.6 million, compensation payments to Boeing’s 737 MAX airline customers of $1.77 billion, and the establishment of a $500 million crash-victim beneficiaries fund to compensate the heirs, relatives, and legal beneficiaries of the 346 passengers who died in the Boeing 737 MAX crashes of Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302. “The tragic crashes of Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 exposed fraudulent and deceptive conduct by employees of one of the world’s leading commercial airplane manufacturers,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General David P. Burns of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “Boeing’s employees chose the path of profit over candor by concealing material information from the FAA concerning the operation of its 737 Max airplane and engaging in an effort to cover up their deception. This resolution holds Boeing accountable for its employees’ criminal misconduct, addresses the financial impact to Boeing’s airline customers, and hopefully provides some measure of compensation to the crash-victims’ families and beneficiaries.”    As Boeing admitted in court documents, Boeing—through two of its 737 MAX Flight Technical Pilots—deceived the FAA AEG about an important aircraft part called the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) that impacted the flight control system of the Boeing 737 MAX. Because of their deception, a key document published by the FAA AEG lacked information about MCAS, and in turn, airplane manuals and pilot-training materials for U.S.-based airlines lacked information about MCAS. Boeing began developing and marketing the 737 MAX in or around June 2011. Before any U.S.-based airline could operate the new 737 MAX, U.S. regulations required the FAA to evaluate and approve the airplane for commercial use. In connection with this process, the FAA AEG was principally responsible for determining the minimum level of pilot training required for a pilot to fly the 737 MAX for a U.S.-based airline, based on the nature and extent of the differences between the 737 MAX and the prior version of Boeing’s 737 airplane, the 737 Next Generation (NG). At the conclusion of this evaluation, the FAA AEG published the 737 MAX Flight Standardization Board Report (FSB Report), which contained relevant information about certain aircraft parts and systems that Boeing was required to incorporate into airplane manuals and pilot-training materials for all U.S.-based airlines. The 737 MAX FSB Report also contained the FAA AEG’s differences-training determination. After the 737 MAX FSB Report was published, Boeing’s airline customers were permitted to fly the 737 MAX. Within Boeing, the 737 MAX Flight Technical Team (composed of 737 MAX Flight Technical Pilots) was principally responsible for identifying and providing to the FAA AEG all information that was relevant to the FAA AEG in connection with the FAA AEG’s publication of the 737 MAX FSB Report. Because flight controls were vital to flying modern commercial airplanes, differences between the flight controls of the 737 NG and the 737 MAX were especially important to the FAA AEG for purposes of its publication of the 737 MAX FSB Report and the FAA AEG’s differences-training determination. In and around November 2016, two of Boeing’s 737 MAX Flight Technical Pilots, one who was then the 737 MAX Chief Technical Pilot and another who would later become the 737 MAX Chief Technical Pilot, discovered information about an important change to MCAS. Rather than sharing information about this change with the FAA AEG, Boeing, through these two 737 MAX Flight Technical Pilots, concealed this information and deceived the FAA AEG about MCAS. Because of this deceit, the FAA AEG deleted all information about MCAS from the final version of the 737 MAX FSB Report published in July 2017. In turn, airplane manuals and pilot training materials for U.S.-based airlines lacked information about MCAS, and pilots flying the 737 MAX for Boeing’s airline customers were not provided any information about MCAS in their manuals and training materials. On Oct. 29, 2018, Lion Air Flight 610, a Boeing 737 MAX, crashed shortly after takeoff into the Java Sea near Indonesia. All 189 passengers and crew on board died. Following the Lion Air crash, the FAA AEG learned that MCAS activated during the flight and may have played a role in the crash. The FAA AEG also learned for the first time about the change to MCAS, including the information about MCAS that Boeing concealed from the FAA AEG. Meanwhile, while investigations into the Lion Air crash continued, the two 737 MAX Flight Technical Pilots continued misleading others—including at Boeing and the FAA—about their prior knowledge of the change to MCAS. On March 10, 2019, Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, a Boeing 737 MAX, crashed shortly after takeoff near Ejere, Ethiopia. All 157 passengers and crew on board died. Following the Ethiopian Airlines crash, the FAA AEG learned that MCAS activated during the flight and may have played a role in the crash. On March 13, 2019, the 737 MAX was officially grounded in the U.S., indefinitely halting further flights of this airplane by any U.S.-based airline. As part of the DPA, Boeing has agreed, among other things, to continue to cooperate with the Fraud Section in any ongoing or future investigations and prosecutions. As part of its cooperation, Boeing is required to report any evidence or allegation of a violation of U.S. fraud laws committed by Boeing’s employees or agents upon any domestic or foreign government agency (including the FAA), regulator, or any of Boeing’s airline customers. In addition, Boeing has agreed to strengthen its compliance program and to enhanced compliance program reporting requirements, which require Boeing to meet with the Fraud Section at least quarterly and to submit yearly reports to the Fraud Section regarding the status of its remediation efforts, the results of its testing of its compliance program, and its proposals to ensure that its compliance program is reasonably designed, implemented, and enforced so that it is effective at deterring and detecting violations of U.S. fraud laws in connection with interactions with any domestic or foreign government agency (including the FAA), regulator, or any of its airline customers. The department reached this resolution with Boeing based on a number of factors, including the nature and seriousness of the offense conduct; Boeing’s failure to timely and voluntarily self‑disclose the offense conduct to the department; and Boeing’s prior history, including a civil FAA settlement agreement from 2015 related to safety and quality issues concerning the Boeing’s Commercial Airplanes (BCA) business unit. In addition, while Boeing’s cooperation ultimately included voluntarily and proactively identifying to the Fraud Section potentially significant documents and Boeing witnesses, and voluntarily organizing voluminous evidence that Boeing was obligated to produce, such cooperation, however, was delayed and only began after the first six months of the Fraud Section’s investigation, during which time Boeing’s response frustrated the Fraud Section’s investigation. ■\n",

      "Vivint Smart Homes Inc. to pay $3.2 million to resolve allegations of false statements Christian Fernsby ▼ | January 7, 2021   Vivint Smart Home Inc. based in Provo, Utah, has agreed to pay the United States $3.2 million to resolve allegations under the FIRREA that Vivint employees made false statements to secure financing for customers’ purchases of Vivint’s home monitoring products, the Justice Department announced. The Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) imposes civil penalties on any person or entity that violates certain predicate federal statutes. Vivint is a provider of smart home monitoring services and frequently obtains new ustomers through door-to-door sales by Vivint sales representatives.  The United States contended that, from 2017 to 2020, certain Vivint sales representatives used their personal funds to cover the cost of initial financing payments on behalf of Vivint customers who sought financing to purchase Vivint’s products, while making false and misleading statements to the federally insured financial institution providing the financing that made it appear as if the borrowers had funded the initial payments. The allegations resolved by the settlement were initially provided to the United States in a declaration submitted under the Financial Institutions Anti-Fraud Enforcement Act, which provides for rewards to eligible declarants who provide information about potential FIRREA violations. The declarant’s share of the recovery in this matter has not yet been determined. ■\n",

      "Lake Turkana, a permanent lake in Kenyan desert Christian Fernsby ▼ | December 7, 2020   Lake Turkana, Africa’s most saline lake, is a wonder located in the arid desert region of the Kenyan Rift Valley. Also known as Lake Rudolf after European visitors named the lake after a 19th century Austrian prince, and Jade Lake for the verdant color of the water, Lake Turkana is a vast but shallow body of water that stretches over 200 kilometers long and up to 30 kilometers wide. Lake Turkana is an imperative resource for peoples in the surrounding desert region, migratory birds including flamingos, cormorants, and kingfishers, and local wildlife like the Nile Crocodile, hippos, and fish such as Nile perch, tigerfish, and tilapia. Lake Turkana and its islands were designated national parks in the 1970s and 80s. In 1997, Lake Turkana National Parks were collectively made a UNESCO World Heritage Site for the region’s extraordinary biodiversity. The eastern side of Lake Turkana is slightly more populated, but supply stations are few and it’s suggested that travelers bring extra gas, drinking water, and camping supplies. ■\n",

      "Bavaria C50, the pleasure of sailing and relaxation Edward Green ▼ | December 17, 2020   The Bavaria C50 sailing yacht is about the pleasure of sailing, but it’s about relaxation too. You can enjoy a fabulous time on water or on land, and with a lot of people. That’s because, as well as a three, four and five‐cabin version there is even a six‐cabin version available. As with the Bavaria C45, the C50 comes in two different equipment levels: ’Holiday’ and ’Style’. A touch of superyacht, even below deck. Everything feels enormous. For example, sit on the big lounge sofa at the saloon table, surrounded by lots of natural light streaming in through the stylish light‐strip. In the evening, an intelligent LED lighting concept creates a pleasant atmosphere. For instance: when dinner is being prepared in the extra‐large pantry and you look up at the starry sky through the big deck hatches. The walk‐on deck is free of edges and steps, the hatches recessed into the deck provide optimum lighting and ventilation. Everything on Bavaria C45 is clear and minimalist, reflecting our understanding of good, modern yacht design. Hull windows: Embedded into the elegant, flat lines of the hull are fabulously large windows that provide more light below deck. XXL bathing platform: 2.68 metres of width for everything that’s fun right next to the water: sunbathing together, swimming, diving there’s space for it all. Nothing should get in the way of the pleasure of sailing. That’s why both helmstands give you a perfect view of the sails and the route ahead. Everything is always in sight including the instruments, which are extremely easy to operate. Even turning is easy, thanks to a self‐tacking jib. The Bavaria C50 also has a good potential for speed. The performance rig is pure joy, even for ambitious sailors, and it makes the yacht fast and safe in any weather. The BAVARIA C50 STYLE is the perfect choice for demanding owners. As its name suggest, it means your holiday can begin. Everything you need is on board anchor winches, navigation instruments and everything else besides. ou can also enjoy the highest degree of seaworthiness that a sailing yacht can offer. ■\n",

Its versatile character is now enhanced with a stylish touch. An exterior finish in Deep Laguna metallic and exclusive design features for the exterior and interior make the new MINI Countryman Boardwalk stand-out both on the metropolitan promenades and during trips to the beach. The model is produced as a limited edition, is immediately available and can be ordered in three model variants. The Deep Laguna metallic body colour effectively showcases the powerfully modelled surfaces of the MINI Countryman. The high-quality shimmering blue tone was previously developed exclusively for the MINI Convertible Sidewalk edition model, also a limited edition, and sparked enthusiasm in the MINI community. Now the wish of many MINI fans to make this colour available for the new MINI Countryman is fulfilled. It is combined with a black contrast finish on the roof and exterior mirror caps. The name of the edition refers to the promenades of traditional seaside resorts in the British home of the MINI brand. The often mile-long walkways, which connect spas and serve as access to the typical English piers, were originally the preferred stage for large social performances. The characteristic pattern of the wooden beams laid longitudinally and diagonally on the promenades now serve as the inspiration for the emblem of the new edition. A stripe pattern in Deep Laguna metallic and black metallic with the lettering BOARDWALK adorns the frame of the side trims known as Side Scuttles. The new MINI Countryman Boardwalk is available in three model variants. In the MINI Cooper Countryman Boardwalk (fuel consumption combined: 5.9 to 5.6 l/100 km; CO2 emissions combined: 135 to 129 g/km) a three-cylinder petrol engine with MINI TwinPower Turbo technology produces a maximum output of 100 kW/136 hp. A four-cylinder petrol engine with 131 kW/178 hp drives the MINI Cooper S Countryman Boardwalk (fuel consumption combined: 6.5 to 6.3 l/100 km; CO2 emissions combined: 148 to 144 g/km) and MINI Cooper S Countryman ALL4 Boardwalk (fuel consumption combined: 6.5 to 6.2 l/100 km; CO2 emissions combined: 149 to 142 g/km). ■\n",

      "Lamborghini Huracan STO, 470 kW for road enjoyment Edward Green ▼ | November 19, 2020   Automobili Lamborghini presented the Lamborghini Huracan STO Super Trofeo Omologata: a road homologated super sports car. With its V10 naturally aspirated 470 kW engine producing 565 Nm on 6,500 rpm, the rear wheel drive Huracan STO delivers exhilarating acceleration of 0 100 km/h in 3.0 seconds, 0 200 km/h in 9.0 seconds and a top speed of 310 km/h. However, its heart beats with the exhilaration and emotion of a racecar. Superior aerodynamic efficiency, extensive use of lightweight materials, unfettered steering and first class braking performance, ensure the Huracan STO delivers the emotion of a track experience on every road drive. The Huracan STO sports an entirely new exterior design, revising its inimitable Lamborghini profile to optimize airflow. Every aspect of the Huracan STO draws on the aerodynamic efficiency and lightweight technologies demanded in motorsports. The Huracan STO embodies the principle that Lamborghini design always follows function: even more valid for a street homologated car inspired by a racecar. The comprehensive aerodynamic solutions inspired by Squadra Corse racecars maximize aerodynamic performance. The Huracan STO uses carbon fiber in more than 75% of its exterior panels, benefiting from complex structures produced as a single component for increased integrity while also reducing weight via less fixing points. Thanks to this technology, the Huracan STO uses 25% less carbon fiber material while maintaining the same structural rigidity. At a dry weight of 1,339 kg, the Huracan STO’s weight is reduced by 43 kg compared to the already lightweight Huracan Performante. The Huracan STO has at its heart the V10 aspirated engine of the Huracan EVO and Super Trofeo, outputting 570 kW and 565 Nm of torque at 6,500 rpm.  With an increased wheel track, stiffer suspension bushing, specific anti roll bars and Lamborghini’s MagneRide 2.0, the STO delivers all the emotion of a racecar while providing a comfortable road experience. The engine has been calibrated for a very sporty and responsive racing feel, with a direct pedal to throttle feeling and improved engine sound sharpness at high revs. The gearchange speed has been further increased to provide a highly responsive and rapid gearshift. ■\n",

      "First ever BMW iX looks very exciting Edward Green ▼ | November 12, 2020   The BMW Group provided a first look ahead to the future BMW iX. The BMW iX is the first model based on a new, modular, scalable future toolkit developed by the BMW Group and focused on a fresh interpretation of design, sustainability, driving pleasure, versatility and luxury. Conceived from the outset for purely electric mobility, the iX sees BMW redefining the successful Sports Activity Vehicle (SAV) concept. With its completely newly developed, precise and minimalist design, the BMW iX is the first representative of a trailblazing generation of cars poised to redefine the driving experience, the feeling of space inside and the relationship between vehicles and those on board. The BMW iX harnesses the latest innovations in the fields of electrification, automated driving and connectivity to deliver a mobility experience which puts people more than ever at its heart. To this end, its design has been developed from the inside out. The BMW iX has been created to provide quality of life and wellbeing for drivers and passengers. The clear and minimalist design of its exterior showcases a new form of mobility geared squarely to the needs of the vehicle’s occupants. The fifth generation of BMW eDrive technology which encompasses the two electric motors, the power electronics, the charging technology and the high-voltage battery guarantees exceptional efficiency. The power unit developed by the BMW Group has been manufactured sustainably without the use of critical raw materials known as rare earths and will, by the most recent calculations, develop maximum output of more than 370 kW/500 hp. That will be enough to power the BMW iX from 0 to 100 km/h in under 5.0 seconds. The new technology toolkit making its debut in the BMW iX also provides the platform for significant progress in the areas of automated driving and digital services. At the centre of the front end stands the prominent, vertically emphasised kidney grille. Since the electric drive system of the BMW iX requires only a small amount of cooling air, the kidney grille is completely blanked off. Its role has duly turned digital and here it functions as an intelligence panel. Camera technology, radar functions and other sensors are integrated seamlessly into the grille behind a transparent surface. ■\n",

      "Crazy, brave, mysterious Tres Tintas wallpapers Martha Taylor-Brown ▼ | November 28, 2020   From the city of Barcelona Tres Tintas brought spectacular wallpaper designs to all who love something beautiful and unexpected. Following, most probably, unconsicously the path that Ildefons Cerdà revolutionary set in the city construction, Tres Tintas went their own way, so different that others, yet so captivating and unexpectedly refined. A family business for decades managed to surprise us with every wallpaper design they bring from international designers. Take, for example, Worn Wood from the Curious collection. A simple idea but so beautifully executed, it brings the nature into your room in an unmistakably Tres Tintas way. Perspective Manoir is something for what you will say \"That's crazy!\" and after that \"I love it!\" This may be the last image caught of a magnificent inner facade. The walls and floor almost caved in when shooting this photograph. The true to size windows offer light and a view where there was previously just a plain wall. Just imagine stepping into a room with Perspective Manoir. There's no doubt you would stand there for a while and admire the imagination that give a totally new look to that part of the house. If you like mechanics and all its intricacies, Steampunk Mechanics is for you. It doesn't matter is your whole design old or modern, this will fit into your room just like that. It is bold and brave, but executed in such a way that's subtle but with a strong message and focal points. And indeed, there are focal points everywhere and you may be sure your room won't be boring anymore. You wil discover new details and patterns everywhere you look and the chance is this will become the most interesting wall in your house. And then there is a stroke of pure genius, Bleached Baroque. Hang this mural in your house and you might find traces of these voices on your walls, as it instantly adds mystery, depth, and character to any space. This work is calling you to look and imagine all stories, events, people, ideas, and lives that might live in it. It looks like a simple picture but again the execution is what differs it from a simple picture. Bleached Baroque is a huge wall of art in your home. One of the best works Tres Tintas has to offer. ■\n",

      "Mikimoto, Japanese legend of timeless cultivated pearls Martha Taylor-Brown ▼ | November 14, 2020   Mikimoto, the pioneer brand in the artificial culture of pearls founded in the 19th century, the first pearl jewelry brand in the world, is one of the world’s top luxury jewelry brands. Mikimoto Kōkichi, born in 1858, was a Japanese entrepreneur who is credited with creating the first cultured pearl and subsequently starting the cultured pearl industry with the establishment of his luxury pearl company Mikimoto. Natural pearls are extremely rare. In the wild, less than one in a thousand oyster shells may produce a pearl during their lifetime: hence they were a luxury only for the wealthy before the creation of cultured pearls. Kokichi Mikimoto decided to try culturing pearls that are loved by people all over the world. He became the first in the world to successfully culture a semi spherical pearl and created his company in 1893. He continued his attempt to culture many different types of pearls, including black and white South Sea cultured pearls. In 1985, Mikimoto was selected as one of Japan's top 10 inventors and was inducted into the house of peers by imperial decree and posthumously awarded the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Sacred Treasure. In 1899, the first Mikimoto pearl shop opened in the fashionable Ginza district of Tokyo selling natural seed pearls and half round pearls. The Mikimoto business expanded internationally, opening stores in London. After World War II, Mikimoto opened stores in Paris, New York City, Chicago, Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Shanghai and Bombay, and was thus one of the first Japanese brands to attain an international presence and recognition. Kokichi sent skilled craftsmen to Europe to learn the latest design techniques and styles in jewelry, including Art Deco and Art Nouveau. Using the experience and knowledge they brought back from Europe, he spent decades blending traditional Japanese craftsmanship and European manufacturing techniques to create the distinctive Mikimoto style. The man for whom Thomas Edison said \"It is one of the wonders of the world that you were able to culture pearls\" managed to create a new art form that lasts for more than 120 years. Too beautiful. ■\n",

      "A piece of luxury in your bathroom Martha Taylor-Brown ▼ | October 24, 2020   In order for the bathroom to become a relaxation zone, it needs to be well equipped and to look beautiful. One of  the key elements of any bathroom is a bathtub and it really can make a difference. Newton bathtub is an outstanding moment of design inspiration and an art piece for your home.  It is very unusual and definitively something you didn't see before but it is worth to take a look if you like unusual and new things.

      "Use colors to bring your kitchen to another level Martha Taylor-Brown ▼ | October 17, 2020   Who doesn’t love colors? Who doesn’t love kitchens? So, blend those two together and you'll have an easy upgrade to one of the most important rooms in your house. As a rule of thumb, if you want to make a statement and improve something to look elegant dark blue is always a good idea. Many colors work well with it and you can stick to blue itself using different hues and shades. The point is that you may use it extensively and there's almost no way to go over the top. And if you think you have too much blue in your kitchen, just add some white or some other bright color in a lighter shade and you're done. It's easy and you can do it yourself with little effort. Yellow is another color that will bring life to your old kitchen but you should use it more carefully than blue. Cabinets painted yellow will make a statement just like that and if you have a lot of them think about painting some of them yellow and some using another, more subtle color. You don't have to match all cabinets, trust your eyes and if you think you already have enough yellow just stop and think about another color for other wooden parts of your kitchen. And, as usual, when you go too far, white details or backsplash will save you. Red is another color that's great but strong. Although there are beautiful kitchen all painted in red, you may enhance you current kitchen with cleverly used red shelves. Red piece of furniture works well with almost every other color, and you can even paint random parts of storage red to get the effect you want. If you add some smaller details in red, say kitchen faucet, your kitchen will look like new and you will have a clear and obvious focal point. Some say white is boring and having an all white kitchen is a sure but boring way to go. We disagree. The point is in details that may convert a usual white kitchen into something very beautiful. Corbels, countertops and decorative elements will transform anything to beautiful if used with style. They may be in white or in some dark color, depending on use, but those small additions will make your kitchen great just like that. That can be added to an existing kitchen so there's no reason not to try them. ■\n",

      "Blancpain Fifty Fathoms Bathyscaphe, a timepiece for adventurers and creative minds Martha Taylor-Brown ▼ | October 10, 2020   Blancpain presented a new version of the Fifty Fathoms Bathyscaphe Day Date watch in 500 piece limited edition. This 500 piece limited edition model was inspired by a Blancpain diver’s watch from the 1970s and it featurs a gradient coloured sandy beige dial featuring a sunburst pattern. That evokes the desert, and more specifically Death Valley in the United States, where Ernest H. Brooks II, the pioneer of underwater photography and contributor to the Edition Fifty Fathoms project, made a spectacular dive in 1962. The dive is Devils Hole, an underwater chasm that plunges into the bowels of the earth at a depth of more than 120 metres before opening out into a big underwater river. The new desert coloured Fifty Fathoms Bathyscaphe Day Date is for adventurers, enthusiasts and creative minds. In the 1970s, Blancpain broke with the traditional aesthetic codes of the Bathyscaphe models producing a series of pieces featuring a cushion shaped case, an inner rotating ring replacing the conventional outer rotating bezel, a gradient coloured grey dial as well as the day of the week and date indication. The dial of the Bathyscaphe Day Date Desert Edition adopts this style, which it combines for the first time with a subtle gradation of sandy beige, a hue that is new to the collection. Its shades and sunburst finish endow it with remarkable clarity, while its boldly sized rectangular hour markers guarantee instant readability of the information displayed. A chapter ring punctuated with Arabic numerals marks the five minute intervals while evoking the inner rotating ring of the 1970s watch. The date and day of the week windows are located at 3 o’clock. The hands are coated with Super LumiNova. The dial of the Fifty Fathoms Bathyscaphe Day Date Desert Edition is enhanced by a unidirectional rotating bezel with a brown ceramic insert and Liquidmetal hour markers. Although this new model has a vintage look, its mechanism is resolutely modern. Housed in a 43 mm satin brushed steel case and water resistant to 30 bar or 300 m, the movement offers all the performance attributes essential to a diver’s watch. It also features a five day power reserve, which is particularly useful in daily life. Another major asset is its balance fitted with a silicon balance spring, a guarantee of accuracy and resistance to magnetic fields. For something over 12,000 euros this is a watch for life. ■\n",

The cheapest version of the Surface Laptop Go since fatures 64GB of eMMC storage and 4GB of RAM. However, step up the range and you got a nice powerful device with more memory and increadible low weight. Surface Laptop Go really is just like a Surface Laptop 3. With a wedge shaped profile, the Surface Laptop 3’s lid and keyboard are clad in aluminium with a smooth matte finish and mirrored Windows logo in the centre. The only difference is that, instead of more aluminium, the base of the laptop is finished in a plastic. Microsoft Surface Laptop Go smart, neat and feels sturdy design enough to take the knocks of everyday abuse. It’s light and slim, too. If portability is key, it’s a very good choice: weighing 1.1kg and measuring 278 x 206 x 15.7mm when closed, you can sling it in your laptop bag. The 12.4 incd display feels comfortably large enough to work on all day. That’s mainly down to its 3:2 aspect ratio, which lends the display a more spacious feel than 16:9 displays with the same diagonal measurements. The keyboard is a delight to type on, there’s enough feedback for frustration free touch typing and there aren’t any major issues with the layout. There’s a fingerprint reader embedded in the power button at the top right, just to the left of the Del key, which works well. Microsoft omits this from the cheapest model. You also get a 720p webcam set into the bezel above the screen. It’s not a bad webcam but it isn’t the best I’ve used, either, and not a patch on the one you get on the Surface Go tablet. The touchpad works without issue, though, and around the edges of the laptop is a sensible selection of ports. On the left edge is a full-sized Type A USB port, a USB port up to 10Gbits/sec and a headset jack. On the right edge, a magnetic Surface Connect port lets you hook up your charger. The resolution is 1,536 x 1,024 (148ppi) and it goes bright enough to be readable in bright conditions. Its presentation of colours is impressive, too. The laptop’s under-keyboard speakers kicking out sound at surprisingly decent volume. ■\n",

Inside the CTA408 is one of the most carefully conceived tube amplification engines available. Driver stage tubes supported by MOSFET circuitry. Numerous individual power supplies, designed to operate with constant power, thereby isolating power stage fluctuations from entering the input stages and eliminating reverse modulation towards the AC supply grid. Dedicated Class A headphone amplifier, excellent J FET  Phono amplifier, active RIAA equalization employing more than one hundred discrete components inside a noise shielding box of its own, The output transformers are Copland in house design, fine tuned for optimal power bandwidth, and the massive core size of the transformers prevents core saturation, and they are able to transfer full power well below 20Hz to the loudspeakers with a minimum of phase shift, are just some of the most interestin features. The amplifier uses the latest variant of the legendary 6550/KT88 power valves and in the CTA408, they surely demonstrate that the everlasting sound qualities of tubes can be extended into regions nowadays dominated by solid stage designs. The huge power tubes are very pleasing to look and therefore, we have decided to make them visible behind lateral perforations on the front panel, thus creating a stunning design to match the sonic virtues of this amplifier. ■\n",

      "Super study: 113 grams of fried food a week lead to heart disease, stroke Christian Fernsby ▼ | January 20, 2021   Eating fried food is tied to an increased risk of heart disease and stroke, a new study suggests. The risk rises with each additional 4-ounce (113 grams) serving per week, a research team in China found. For the study, the investigators analyzed 19 previously published studies. They combined data from 17 studies, involving more than 560,000 people with nearly 37,000 major cardiovascular events, such as heart attack or stroke. The researchers also used data from six studies, involving more than 750,000 participants and nearly 86,000 deaths over an average of 10 years. The study findings showed that compared with those who ate the lowest amount of fried food per week, those who ate the most had a 28% greater risk of major cardiovascular events, a 22% higher risk of heart disease and a 37% higher risk of heart failure. These risks substantially increased by 3%, 2% and 12%, respectively, with each additional 4-ounce weekly serving, according to Pei Qin, of Shenzhen University Health Science Center, in Guangdong, China, and colleagues.

The studies on Comirnaty (Pfizer-BioNTech) included few participants aged over 85 and did not include patients with unstable or acute illness, according to NoMA. \"The assessment suggests that common adverse reactions to mRNA vaccines, such as fever and nausea, may have contributed to a fatal outcome in some frail patients,\" said Sigurd Hortemo, NoMA's chief physician. Reports of suspected adverse reactions including death are received on a daily basis and are continuously assessed by both the Norwegian Medicines Agency and the National Institute of Public Health (NIPH), said the press release. As a result of 13 autopsies of the deceased undertaken for the assessment, the NIPH has updated the COVID-19 vaccination guidelines, providing more detailed advice on the vaccination of the elderly who are frail. \"For those with the most serious frailty, however, even relatively mild vaccine side effects can have serious consequences. For those who have a very short remaining life span anyway, the benefit of the vaccine can be marginal or irrelevant,\" said the updated NIPH guidelines. \"In Norwegian nursing homes, about 400 people die a week. All deaths that occur in time in connection with the vaccination are carefully assessed, and there is no indication that the vaccine causes deaths,\" said Steinar Madsen, medical director of the NoMA. \"Doctors must now carefully consider who should be vaccinated.

      "Astronomers spot mega radio galaxies dwarfing Milky Way Christian Fernsby ▼ | January 20, 2021   Astronomers have discovered the two largest-known radio galaxies to date. 62 times the size of our own Milky Way, they are believed to be the largest single objects yet found in the universe. Radio galaxies, characterized by their large powerful billowing jets of radio emissions from a supermassive black hole gobbling mass at their centers, are fairly common in space. A large team of researchers led by the University of Cape Town, South Africa, however, this month said they managed to find not one but two huge radio galaxies over a small patch of sky. “We found these giant radio galaxies in a region of sky which is only about four times the area of the full Moon,” said Jacinta Delhaize, lead author of a study into the discovery published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society and a research fellow at the university. “Based on our current knowledge of the density of giant radio galaxies in the sky, the probability of finding two of them in this region is less than 0.0003 per cent.\" Delhaize reckons the discovery isn’t just a stroke of luck: she reckons the findings show gigantic radio galaxies are actually more common than previously believed. Only 800 radio-jet-emitting galaxies larger than 700 kiloparsecs have been detected so far, we’re told. Despite their sheer size, they’re difficult to spot. Their large distances from Earth mean that their massive plumes of radiation are very faint. The astronomers were able to see these two objects as part of the MeerKAT International Gigahertz Tiered Extragalactic Exploration (MIGHTEE) survey, thanks to an array of radio telescopes located in the Northern Cape of South Africa. Giant radio galaxies are believed to be older than their smaller counterparts. The radio jets have had more time to extend to greater distances. Astronomers are particularly interested in how their extreme environments affect the galaxy’s evolution and lifetime. ■\n",

According to the Lunar Exploration and Space Program Center of the China National Space Administration, the 10 selected names have come out after a global naming campaign that kicked off in late July 2020. In October, a panel of 32 experts selected 10 semifinalists after evaluating more than 39,000 submissions from 38 countries and regions. The participants ranged from 7 to 95 years old. These include \"Hongyi,\" which means having a broad and strong mind in Chinese, \"Qilin,\" a legendary animal, and \"Nezha,\" a beloved Chinese mythological figure. The final name will be announced when Tianwen-1 lands on Mars, the administration added. China launched its Mars probe Tianwen-1 on July 23, 2020. The spacecraft, consisting of an orbiter, a lander and a rover, is expected to reach the planet around February. ■\n",

      "A planet like no other Christian Fernsby ▼ | January 19, 2021   The core mass of the giant exoplanet WASP-107b is much lower than what was thought necessary to build up the immense gas envelope surrounding giant planets like Jupiter and Saturn, astronomers at Université de Montréal have found. This intriguing discovery by Ph.D. student Caroline Piaulet of UdeM's Institute for Research on Exoplanets (iREx) suggests that gas-giant planets form a lot more easily than previously believed. Piaulet is part of the groundbreaking research team of UdeM astrophysics professor Björn Benneke that in 2019 announced the first detection of water on an exoplanet located in its star's habitable zone. Published today in the Astronomical Journal with colleagues in Canada, the U.S., Germany and Japan, the new analysis of WASP-107b's internal structure \"has big implications,\" said Benneke. \"This work addresses the very foundations of how giant planets can form and grow,\" he said. \"It provides concrete proof that massive accretion of a gas envelope can be triggered for cores that are much less massive than previously thought.\" WASP-107b was first detected in 2017 around WASP-107, a star about 212 light years from Earth in the Virgo constellation. The planet is very close to its star—over 16 times closer than the Earth is to the Sun. As big as Jupiter but 10 times lighter, WASP-107b is one of the least dense exoplanets known: a type that astrophysicists have dubbed \"super-puff\" or \"cotton-candy\" planets. Piaulet and her team first used observations of WASP-107b obtained at the Keck Observatory in Hawai'i to assess its mass more accurately. They used the radial velocity method, which allows scientists to determine a planet's mass by observing the wobbling motion of its host star due to the planet's gravitational pull. They concluded that the mass of WASP-107b is about one tenth that of Jupiter, or about 30 times that of Earth. The team then did an analysis to determine the planet's most likely internal structure. They came to a surprising conclusion: with such a low density, the planet must have a solid core of no more than four times the mass of the Earth. This means that more than 85 percent of its mass is included in the thick layer of gas that surrounds this core. By comparison, Neptune, which has a similar mass to WASP-107b, only has 5 to 15 percent of its total mass in its gas layer. \"We had a lot of questions about WASP-107b,\" said Piaulet. \"How could a planet of such low density form? And how did it keep its huge layer of gas from escaping, especially given the planet's close proximity to its star? \"This motivated us to do a thorough analysis to determine its formation history.\" Planets form in the disc of dust and gas that surrounds a young star called a protoplanetary disc. Classical models of gas-giant planet formation are based on Jupiter and Saturn. In these, a solid core at least 10 times more massive than the Earth is needed to accumulate a large amount of gas before the disc dissipates. Without a massive core, gas-giant planets were not thought able to cross the critical threshold necessary to build up and retain their large gas envelopes. How then do explain the existence of WASP-107b, which has a much less massive core? McGill University professor and iREx member Eve Lee, a world-renowned expert on super-puff planets like WASP-107b, has several hypotheses. \"For WASP-107b, the most plausible scenario is that the planet formed far away from the star, where the gas in the disc is cold enough that gas accretion can occur very quickly,\" she said. \"The planet was later able to migrate to its current position, either through interactions with the disc or with other planets in the system.\" The Keck observations of the WASP-107 system cover a much longer period of time than previous studies have, allowing the UdeM-led research team to make an additional discovery: the existence of a second planet, WASP-107c, with a mass of about one-third that of Jupiter, considerably more than WASP-107b's. WASP-107c is also much farther from the central star; it takes three years to complete one orbit around it, compared to only 5.7 days for WASP-107b. Also interesting: the eccentricity of this second planet is high, meaning its trajectory around its star is more oval than circular. \"WASP-107c has in some respects kept the memory of what happened in its system,\" said Piaulet. \"Its great eccentricity hints at a rather chaotic past, with interactions between the planets which could have led to significant displacements, like the one suspected for WASP-107b.\" Beyond its formation history, there are still many mysteries surrounding WASP-107b. Studies of the planet's atmosphere with the Hubble Space Telescope published in 2018 revealed one surprise: it contains very little methane. \"That's strange, because for this type of planet, methane should be abundant,\" said Piaulet. \"We're now reanalysing Hubble's observations with the new mass of the planet to see how it will affect the results, and to examine what mechanisms might explain the destruction of methane.\" The young researcher plans to continue studying WASP-107b, hopefully with the James Webb Space Telescope set to launch in 2021, which will provide a much more precise idea of the composition of the planet's atmosphere. \"Exoplanets like WASP-107b that have no analogue in our Solar System allow us to better understand the mechanisms of planet formation in general and the resulting variety of exoplanets,\" she said. \"It motivates us to study them in great detail.\" \"WASP-107b's density is even lower: a case study for the physics of gas envelope accretion and orbital migration,\" by Caroline Piaulet et al., was posted today in the Astronomical Journal. ■\n",

      "Bangladesh to build first space observatory center Christian Fernsby ▼ | January 18, 2021   In a first, Bangladesh plans setting up a space observatory center as part of the birth centenary celebrations of Sheikh Mujibur Rehman, the country's founder, officials said on Sunday. A proposal has been sent for approval to the National Economic Council, the apex body which approves government projects, Md. Abdul Momin, a joint secretary at the Ministry of Science and Technology, told Anadolu Agency. Earlier, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina accepted the proposal in principle and directed the ministry to initiate the necessary action. The project titled Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Space Observatory Centre will be built on a 10-acre plot in Faridpur district at an estimated cost of $25 million, according to the project proposal. It is expected to be completed by June 2023, and will have a 5-storey circular building that will house reflector telescopes. The height of the observatory tower will be kept at 100 meters. According to Mohammad Munir Chowdhury, the head of National Museum of Science and Technology, the spot chosen is an ideal location for the observatory, whose objective is to gear up technological progress, and create opportunities for space research in the South Asian country. ■\n",

The count, which takes place from February 5-14, is run by the Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust (GWCT). It aims to assess the effect of conservation schemes on farms and estates, such as supplementary feeding or growing wild bird seed or game cover crops. “Farmers and gamekeepers are vital in helping to ensure the survival of many of our farmland bird species such as skylark, yellowhammer and wild grey partridge,” said the GWCT. It encouraged people wishing to take part in the count to visit its dedicated website. “Then, between February 5 and 14, they should spend about 30 minutes recording the species and number of birds seen on one particular area of the farm – somewhere with a good view of around two hectares of the farm is ideal,” added the GWCT. “Ideally, counting should take place at first light as this is when the birds are most active. “However, what is most important is that you take part and submit a return, so timings should suit whoever is doing the count.” ■\n",

Egypt's former antiquities minister, archaeologist Zahi Hawass, revealed details of the treasures found in the vast Saqqara necropolis south of Cairo. Experts found a four-metre long papyrus that included texts of the Book of the Dead, which is a collection of spells aimed at directing the dead through the underworld in ancient Egypt. At least 22 burial wells were also discovered, containing 54 wooden coffins dating back to the New Kingdom that ruled Egypt between about 1570 BC and 1069 BC. Ancient games, statues, and masks were also found. On a nearby site, archaeologists unearthed the temple of Queen Neit, wife of King Teti, the first king of the Sixth Dynasty that ruled Egypt from 2323 BC until 2150 BC. ■\n",

      "First human culture lasted 20,000 years longer than thought Christian Fernsby ▼ | January 13, 2021   Fieldwork led by Dr. Eleanor Scerri, head of the Pan-African Evolution Research Group at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Germany and Dr. Khady Niang of the University of Cheikh Anta Diop in Senegal, has documented the youngest known occurrence of the Middle Stone Age. This repertoire of stone flaking methods and the resulting tools includes distinctive ways of producing sharp flakes by carefully preparing nodules of rock, some of which were sometimes further shaped into tool forms known as 'scrapers' and 'points.\" Middle Stone Age finds most commonly occur in the African record between around 300 thousand and 30 thousand years ago, after which point they largely vanish. It was long thought that these tool types were replaced after 30 thousand years ago by a radically different, miniaturized toolkit better suited to diversified subsistence strategies and patterns of mobility across Africa. In a paper published in Scientific Reports this week, Scerri and colleagues show that groups of hunter-gatherers in what is today Senegal continued to use Middle Stone Age technologies associated with our species' earliest prehistory as late as 11 thousand years ago. This contrasts with the long-held view that humanity's major prehistoric cultural phases occurred in a neat and universal sequence. \"West Africa is a real frontier for human evolutionary studies—we know almost nothing about what happened here in deep prehistory. Almost everything we know about human origins is extrapolated from discoveries in small parts of eastern and southern Africa,\" says Dr. Scerri, the lead author of the study. To redress this gap in the data, Scerri and Niang put together a research program to explore different regions of Senegal. The program ranges from Senegal's desert edges to its forests and along different stretches of its major river systems: the Senegal and the Gambia, where they found multiple Middle Stone Age sites, all with surprisingly young dates. \"These discoveries demonstrate the importance of investigating the whole of the African continent, if we are to really get a handle on the deep human past,\" says Dr. Niang. \"Prior to our work, the story from the rest of Africa suggested that well before 11 thousand years ago, the last traces of the Middle Stone Age—and the lifeways it reflects—were long gone.\" Explaining why this region of West Africa was home to such a late persistence of Middle Stone Age culture is not straightforward. \"To the north, the region meets the Sahara Desert,\" explains Dr. Jimbob Blinkhorn, one of the paper's authors. \"To the east, there are the Central African rainforests, which were often cut off from the West African rainforests during periods of drought and fragmentation. Even the river systems in West Africa form a self-contained and isolated group.\" \"It is also possible that this region of Africa was less affected by the extremes of repeated cycles of climate change,\" adds Scerri. \"If this was the case, the relative isolation and habitat stability may simply have resulted in little need for radical changes in subsistence, as reflected in the successful use of these traditional toolkits.\" \"All we can be sure about is that this persistence is not simply about a lack of capacity to invest in the development of new technologies. These people were intelligent, they knew how to select good stone for their tool making and exploit the landscape they lived in,\" says Niang. The results fit in with a wider, emerging view that for most of humanity's deep prehistory, populations were relatively isolated from each other, living in subdivided groups in different regions. Accompanying this striking finding is the fact that in West Africa, the major cultural shift to more miniaturized toolkits also occurs extremely late compared to the rest of the continent. For a relatively short time, Middle Stone Age using populations lived alongside others using the more recently developed miniaturized tool kits, referred to as the \"Later Stone Age.\" \"This matches genetic studies suggesting that African people living in the last ten thousand years lived in very subdivided populations,\" says Dr. Niang. \"We aren't sure why, but apart from physical distance, it may be the case that some cultural boundaries also existed. Perhaps the populations using these different material cultures also lived in slightly different ecological niches.\" Around 15 thousand years ago, there was a major increase in humidity and forest growth in central and western Africa, that perhaps linked different areas and provided corridors for dispersal. This may have spelled the final end for humanity's first and earliest cultural repertoire and initiated a new period of genetic and cultural mixing. \"These findings do not fit a simple unilinear model of cultural change towards 'modernity,'\" explains Scerri.\" Groups of hunter-gatherers embedded in radically different technological traditions occupied neighboring regions of Africa for thousands of years, and sometimes shared the same regions. Long isolated regions, on the other hand, may have been important reservoirs of cultural and genetic diversity,\" she adds. \"This may have been a defining factor in the success of our species.\" ■\n",

      "'Super Earth' discovered near one of our galaxy's oldest stars Christian Fernsby ▼ | January 12, 2021   A hot, rocky \"super Earth,\" near one of the oldest stars in the galaxy has taken a team of planet-hunting scientists by surprise. \"For every day you're on Earth, this planet orbits its star twice,\" said UC Riverside planetary astrophysicist and team member Stephen Kane. Part of the reason for the short orbit is the planet's proximity to its star, which also creates incredible heat. Its estimated average surface temperature is over 2,000 degrees Kelvin—much too toasty to host life as we know it today, though it may once have been possible. In addition, Kane said that although the planet has roughly three times the mass of Earth, the team calculated its density to be the same as our planet. \"This is surprising because you'd expect the density to be higher,\" Kane said. \"This is consistent with the notion that the planet is extremely old.\" The older a planet is, the less dense it's likely to be because not as many heavy elements were available when it formed, explained Kane. Heavy elements are produced by fusion reactions in stars as they age. Eventually stars explode, dispersing these elements from which new stars and planets will form. Discovery of planet TOI-561b, and additional observations the team made about its composition, have been accepted for publication in the Astronomical Journal and are being presented Jan. 11 at the 2021 meeting of the American Astronomical Society. \"TOI-561b is one of the oldest rocky planets yet discovered,\" said University of Hawaii postdoctoral fellow and team lead Lauren Weiss. \"Its existence shows that the universe has been forming rocky planets almost since its inception 14 billion years ago.\" Named for NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, TESS Object of Interest (TOI) 561 belongs to a rare population of stars called the galactic thick disk. Stars in this region are chemically distinct, with fewer heavy elements such as iron or magnesium that are associated with planet building. The TESS Mission team used the University of California's access to the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii—home to some of the most scientifically productive telescopes on Earth—to confirm the presence of planet TOI-561b. The observatory's equipment also helped the team calculate the planet's mass, density and radius. Astronomers are continually trying to understand the relationship between the mass and radius of the planets they find. This information yields insight about the interior structure of planets that with today's technology are too far away to visit and sample. \"Information about a planet's interior gives us a sense of whether the surface of the planet is habitable by life as we know it,\" Kane said. \"Though this particular planet is unlikely to be inhabited today, it may be a harbinger of a many rocky worlds yet to be discovered around our galaxy's oldest stars.\" ■\n",

      "Sharing leftover meat may have contributed to early dog domestication Christian Fernsby ▼ | January 8, 2021   Humans feeding leftover lean meat to wolves during harsh winters may have had a role in the early domestication of dogs, towards the end of the last ice age (14,000 to 29,000 years ago), according to a study published in Scientific Reports. Maria Lahtinen and colleagues used simple energy content calculations to estimate how much energy would have been left over by humans from the meat of species they may have hunted 14,000 to 29,000 years that were also typical wolf prey species, such as horses, moose and deer. The authors hypothesized that if wolves and humans had hunted the same animals during harsh winters, humans would have killed wolves to reduce competition rather than domesticate them. With the exception of Mustelids such as weasels, the authors found that all prey species would have supplied more protein than humans could consume, resulting in excess lean meat that could be fed to wolves, thus reducing the competition for prey. Although humans may have relied on an animal-based diet during winters when plant-based foods were limited, they were probably not adapted to an entirely protein-based diet and may have favored meat rich in fat and grease over lean, protein-rich meat. As wolves can survive on a solely protein-based diet for months, humans may have fed excess lean meat to pet wolves, which may have enabled companionship even during harsh winter months. Feeding excess meat to wolves may have facilitated co-living with captured wolves and the use of pet wolves as hunting aids and guards may have further facilitated the domestication process, eventually to full dog domestication. ■\n",

      "Study of nebula IRAS 00500+6713 suggests its central star is unlike any seen before Christian Fernsby ▼ | January 7, 2021   A team of researchers from Potsdam University and Kazan Federal University has found evidence of a previously unknown kind of star in nebula IRAS 00500+6713. In their paper published in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics, the group describes their study of the nebula and its central star and what they believe it represents. Nebulas are clouds of dust and gas in certain regions in space—many of them can be seen with the naked eye in the night sky. Nebulas can also be associated with single or multiple star systems. In this new effort, the researchers were studying the nebula IRAS 00500+6713 because last year, another team of researchers had discovered a central star, called J005311, with a stellar wind of unusually high speeds. In taking a closer look at the star and its history, the researchers found that it had formed due to a collision between two white dwarves—an event that typically leads to a supernova and annihilation of both stars. Prior research has also shown, however, that when such stars collide, one or both of the stars may survive—and sometimes, they merge. The researchers found evidence suggesting that J005311 had formed as a merger. But the resulting star had unique attributes. It emitted unusual X-rays and was brighter than expected, suggesting it was too massive to be a white dwarf. Further study showed the star to have a unique composition dominated by oxygen and neon. That finding suggested the star was an unstable byproduct of two white dwarves colliding without creating a new white dwarf—instead, a new kind of star was born. The researchers suggest its instability suggests it likely will not last any longer than 10,000 years. Observations of the nebula by the team at the XMM-Newton space telescope (run by the European Space Agency) allowed them to determine its chemical composition and that of its central star. They found both contained unusual amounts of silicon, sulfur and neon. They also found evidence showing the star to be filled with very hot gas. They suggest that the star is of a type that has never been seen before. ■\n",
