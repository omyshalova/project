      "https://www.really-learn-english.com/english-reading-comprehension-barcelona.html\n",
      "Lying on the northeastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea, Barcelona is a fusion of Roman, Gothic and modern architecture. Even though it is smaller than the capital city of Madrid, Barcelona is the main tourist destination in Spain. With its warm weather, sun-drenched beaches and bustling streets, this port city is a perfect gateway into the Mediterranean culture.   This Roman  Catholic church is the jewel of Antoni Gaudi's legacy in the city. Although the  construction of Sagrada Familia commenced in 1882, the building still remains  unfinished. The architect, Gaudi devoted his life to this church, and even so,  only a quarter of the project was complete at the time of his death in 1926.  Once finished, the church will be as tall as the tallest mountain in the area,  because Guadi believed that no man-made structure should rise above a God's  creation. With its tall ceilings and glass windows that produce beautiful  natural light, Sagrada Familia's interior offers a once in a life time  experience for all visitors.  Modern Barcelona  is all about the unique designs of Antoni Gaudi. Park Guell is another of his  masterpieces. It is a public park, composed of gardens and dream-like buildings  and sculptures. In Park Guell, tourists can also visit the Gaudi House Museum,  which contains some of the furniture he designed. The gardens are unique for  their mosaic works, the most famous being the multicolored salamander  (lizard-like animal), known as the dragon (el  drac), greeting all of the park's visitors at the main entrance.  Gothic Quarter (Barri Gotic) is the center of the old  city of Barcelona. While the neighborhood includes some of the oldest parts of  the city, such as the Roman wall, most of the buildings date back to the past  two centuries. As such, it is a beautiful mixture of different layers of  history. The narrow streets of the Gothic Quarter form a labyrinth, intercepted  by city squares. With the majority of streets being closed for regular traffic,  this neighborhood offers some of the necessary peace and quiet in the city.For those interested in the older history of  Barcelona found in the Gothic Quarter, Temple of Augustus is a must-see. This  Roman Temple, built in the 1st century BC, was the central building in Barcino, the Roman name for Barcelona. Although  the temple ceased to exist, its columns remained intact and were later on  incorporated into the buildings constructed around them. Their ruins,  discovered in the late 19th century, are kept indoors for  preservation. Only four columns remain out of the original 24. \n",
      "2-Beauty Rituals around the World\n",
      "https://www.really-learn-english.com/english-reading-comprehension-beauty-rituals-around-the-world.html\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  A ritual is a ceremony, an event that takes place in a particular order on a regular basis. For at least 6,000 years, people, especially women, in nearly all societies in the world, have been performing daily rituals with the purpose of making themselves beautiful. Skin and hair care products (called cosmetics) are not modern inventions, because ancient societies used them, too. In fact, some of the present-day beauty rituals have roots in very old practices.  For more than 2,000 years, women of  Myanmar (formerly known as Burma) have been using ground wood or roots of the  thanaka tree to make a cosmetic paste which protects their skin from the sun.  This yellowish paste has a pleasant smell, and it is often applied to the face  in very attractive designs, covering cheeks and forehead. Besides cooling the  skin and providing protection from sunburn, thanaka is also used against acne  (red spots on the skin). Believed to be Myanmar's secret to smooth skin,  thanaka powder is also used in other neighboring countries in Southeast Asia.Popularly used as a skin and hair softener  among French Polynesians, monoi oil has also become a promising beauty product  in Europe. The method of soaking petals, the colored parts of Tiaré flowers in  coconut oil is 2,000 years old. First European explorers who came to Polynesia documented  that the locals used monoi oil at every stage of their lives - from birth until  death - not only for cosmetic purposes, but also as medicine. Nowadays, monoi  oil is used as an after-shower lotion to rehydrate the skin. It is a great  tanning oil because it protects from any harmful effects of the sun, yet it  still allows the skin to tan. The empress Wu Ze Tian of China (7th  century) regularly put pearl powder on her skin. Hundreds of year later,  Chinese medical books recorded that oyster pearls encourage skin growth and  remove any signs of ageing. This beauty method is still used in China and other  parts of Asia. In fact, in the Shanghai area, oysters are cultivated especially  for the purpose of making pearl powder. To produce the powder, freshwater  pearls are first boiled and then milled, either using porcelain or stainless  steel. The powder can be used on its own, or added to creams. This beauty product, made from fat  extracted from the shea tree nut, is widely used in cosmetics. Traditionally  applied in its crude form, it is nowadays added to widespread cosmetics  products such as body lotions and soaps. The butter works as a moisturizer for  dry skin and a hair conditioner for brittle hair. The earliest records show  even Cleopatra had caravans of shea butter delivered to her to use for her  skin. Shea butter is particularly useful during the dry season in countries  like Ghana to prevent skin damage. What's more, it can also be edible and can be used  instead of cooking oil.Although a bath of mud does not sound very  appealing, people have been using it in their beauty rituals for thousands of  years. In places like California and Florida, mud, a mixture of volcanic ash  and hot mineral waters, is a very popular bath treatment. Black mud from the  Dead Sea in Israel is also believed to have multiple health benefits, and that  it can cleanse the skin. For all those who cannot travel to these selected  locations with natural mud baths, beauty products that include some of the original  mud are sold all over the world. Luxury spas also offer mud baths. \n",
      "3-Belfast \n",
      "https://www.really-learn-english.com/english-reading-comprehension-belfast.html\n",
      "For long, Belfast  (Gaelic for river mouth) was a  forgotten city on the tourist map of the United Kingdom (UK). Located in  Northern Ireland far away from London, this increasingly popular destination  will surprise you with its art, waterfronts, diversity and the stunning nature.  Influenced by both Ireland and Britain, Belfast enchants every single visitor.    The main central building of the  Queen's University in Belfast will leave you astonished with its red  Victorian-style exterior. This university is not one of the oldest in the UK,  but it certainly is one of the most beautiful ones. From the campus, you can  enter the Botanical Gardens, the locals' favorite green space in the city.  Among other things, the garden is famous for its Tropical Ravine, where  visitors can observe a variety of tropical animals and plants.  Many tourists visit Belfast  primarily because of its street art. On the one hand, there are over 300 murals,  paintings on walls, which often convey political messages. This type of art was  embraced as a form of expression during the Troubles. On the other hand, modern  street artists gather in Belfast each year to produce new attractive paintings  on city buildings. The themes vary, so the paintings can depict anything – from  a famous person to a mythical creature. As they are sometimes as tall as the  building they are on, these paintings are really hard to miss.  Not many people know that the  famous ship which tragically sank in 1912, Titanic, was actually built at the  docks of Belfast. Titanic slipways, the place where Titanic first touched the  water, have been reconstructed and now serve as a venue for cultural events. In  the area, known as the Titanic Quarter, you will also be able to take a boat  tour to see where Titanic was built, or to pick a meal from the Titanic menu.  Although the building that  currently hosts St George's Market was built in 1896, there has been a regular Friday  market on this particular site since 1604. Considering its history, the market  is one of the oldest and most visited attractions in Belfast. Placed inside a  glorious Victorian building, the market offers a variety of produce: Irish  crafts, freshly made Irish stew, and local wool products. Going to this market  after the traditional St. Patrick's Day Parade for some live music is a must.\n",
      "4-Berlin \n",
      "https://www.really-learn-english.com/english-reading-comprehension-berlin.html\n",
      "Very few cities speak of the history of the 20th century in so much detail like Berlin does. Berlin, the capital of Germany and one of the most multicultural cities in the world, was greatly affected by several wars in the past century. As such, this city stands as an important witness to the turbulent history of the continent, but also as a representative of a united, peaceful and diverse Europe.   After  World War II, Germany was divided amongst the winning powers. East Berlin subsequently  fell into the hands of the Soviets, who installed a communist regime in the  entire East Germany. The differences in the living conditions in these  different parts of the city became visible really quickly, and the developed West  became more attractive to people. To make sure nobody escapes from East Berlin,  East Germans permanently closed the border between East and West by building a  wall – now known as the Berlin Wall –  which stretched through the entire city. The wall was constantly monitored by  soldiers stationed in more than 300 watchtowers. Although  the Wall was torn down in 1989 and East and West were united again, some  remnants of the wall are still kept in the city and available for tourists to  see. Nowadays, the former East Berlin has  evolved into a vibrant cultural hub. This part of the city now gathers numerous  artists, who paint on walls and organize exhibitions. It is also where students  and young people hang out.  Although built  in the 18th century on the orders of Prussian king Frederick to  celebrate an important victory, the Brandenburg Gate has become a symbol of  modern Berlin. When East and West Germany were divided, the gate actually  became a part of the Berlin Wall and was incorporated into the border between  two countries. For this reason, the Brandenburg Gate today is a proof of a  unified Germany, but also as the best symbol of peace and prosperity in the  whole of Europe. Being a rather central point in the city, the gate attracts  great numbers of tourists.  The Reichstag,  located near the Brandenburg Gate, currently serves as the German Parliament  building. The building was the center of German political power until 1933, when  it was set on fire and severely damaged. After that, the building was not used  for political purposes, and was only renovated and rediscovered in 1999. At the  top of the Reichstag lies a large glass dome which offers a 360-degree view of  Berlin cityscape. Prior registration is needed if you want to join one of the  free tours of the building and should be made well in advance, particularly to  visit the dome or the terrace.  Berlin  Cathedral, also known as Berlin Dom,  is one of the most magnificent buildings in Berlin. Although it looks like its  centuries old, the current building was only finished in 1905. Yet, the site of  the cathedral has been an important place of worship since the 15th century.  Its roof and windows were reconstructed after World War II, but the church  interior still offers a number of older decorations and ornaments worth seeing.\n",
      "5-Bitcoin \n",
      "https://www.really-learn-english.com/english-reading-comprehension-bitcoin.html\n",
      "Bitcoin is an alternative type of payment system. It is a type of internet or digital money. You can use it to do business outside mainstream financial services.  Bitcoin is basically digital cash. It works just like an online wallet. You can send money in your online wallet to your friends, buy stuff online and offline, or even invest in it, like you would do with stocks.    Bitcoin was created as a response to the  criticism suggesting that big banks are corrupt and not accountable, constantly  misusing clients' money and charging enormous fees. The creator of Bitcoin invented  something that eliminates the middleman – or, in this case, the bank - from  financial exchanges. Because the Bitcoin system is decentralized, all  transactions are very transparent, so there is no corruption. The clients  always know what is going on and can control their own money. In brief, it is a  virtual currency, and the users are free to choose among checks, wiring or cash  when they want to make a transaction. \n",
      "\n",
      "  A word often associated with Bitcoin is  \"blockchain\", which is where all confirmed transactions Bitcoin users make are  placed as \"blocks\". More specifically, whenever a \"block\", or a transaction,  enters the online system, its validation is needed on the peer-to-peer computer  network. That means that all Bitcoin users are aware of every single block, and  this makes stealing or spending the same currency twice impossible. This is one  of the reasons why millions of people trust Bitcoin and see a very bright  future ahead of it. All transactions occur only between the buyer and the  seller, with the help of private \"keys\", or passwords, they come up with, and their  electronic gadgets.  Even though it is only several years old,  Bitcoin has permeated to businesses and households around the world. Even billion-dollar  businesses like PayPal and Microsoft allow their customers to use Bitcoin to  pay for services. It is also possible to buy a necklace or a ring from the REED  Jewelers jewelry chain in the United States using Bitcoin. In addition, people  in living in the countries with high levels of corruption find Bitcoin to be  the easiest and most reliable channel for sending and receiving money.At  first, all new users must install a virtual wallet onto their electronic  devices. This wallet is like an online bank account where all future  transactions will be noted. Next step, Bitcoin needs some real money which will  be translated into a virtual currency. This can be done through an online  payment, a bank transfer or a third-party website. Once the funds are stored in  the virtual wallet, the users should order bitcoins and then use them as they  please. This simple process is very similar to trading stocks, for example. \n",

      "6-Boston \n",
      "https://www.really-learn-english.com/english-reading-comprehension-boston.html\n",
      "Boston, the capital of the state of Massachusetts, is one of the most popular tourist locations in the United States (US). Historically, it has been a very important site for the US and, over the years, it has become famous for the prestigious universities such as Harvard and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) located in the Boston area. It is also known as the center of American philanthropy.   The best way to  learn about the historical importance of Boston is to follow the Freedom Trail.  This is a 2.5-mile-long (4 km) path that stretches through the city, passing by  16 different locations of historical significance. The stops, marked with  special markers implanted in the sidewalks, include churches, notable  buildings, as well as graveyards. Tourists are free to explore the stops on the  map by themselves, but the visitors centers also provide maps and give all the  relevant information and tips about the stops.  Built in 1713,  the Old State House is a building of historical importance and it is listed as  one of the locations on the Freedom Trail. Built on the site where the previous  Town House burned in a fire, this building was the seat of the General Court at  first. The Old State House later hosted Boston's City Hall, and had a brief  period of commercial use. Since 1881, the Old State house has been stewarded by  the Bostonian Society, established to preserve it. It serves as a museum.  Quincy Market is  a historic market located in central Boston. Constructed in 1826, the market  was named after Boston Mayor Josiah Quincy, who organized the building of the  market with no tax or debt. Its red brick interior walls in combination with  Roman-style facades make the building quite unique. Today, Quincy Market is a  place where you can see how international Boston truly is. At the market, you  can find classic Bostonian food, such as Boston cream pie, the official dessert  of Massachusetts, and clam chowder, popular cream based seafood soup. At the  same time, you can try food from nearly every corner of the world at Quincy  Market, which shows how ethnically diverse Boston is.\n",
      "7-Bucharest \n",
      "https://www.really-learn-english.com/english-reading-comprehension-bucharest.html\n",
      "Bucharest, the  capital of Romania and one of the largest cities in the European Union, is by  far underrated. Known as \"The Little Paris\" because of its Arch of Triumph,  similar to the one in the capital of France, this is a city where finding a  centuries-old church and a glass office building next to it is quite common.  Bucharest is a place of beautiful contrasts worth exploring.   It is not  well-known that Bucharest is home to the largest parliament building in the  world, also known as the People's House. Built during the communist era, this  massive construction has 3,100 rooms. Most rooms are made of pure marble, and  are beautifully decorated with traditional Romanian ornaments. Even though the  Palace hosts the Senate, three museums and an international conference center,  70% of the building remains empty. Tourists can access only some of these  rooms, as well as the balcony which Romania's dictator Nicolae Ceausescu used  to speak to the crowds.  Formerly known  as the Palace Square, this square was renamed after the 1989 Romanian  Revolution which ended communism and brought democracy. People of Bucharest  remember this square as the place where Ceausescu rose to power, but also where  he later gave his final speech in 1989. As such, the Revolution Square is an  important place of remembrance and a representative of the national identity of  the country. It is also a great starting point for tourists interested in  walking tours due to its central location.  This lovely  garden can be found only 200 meters away from Revolution Square. More than 150  years old, Cismigiu Garden is home to 30,000 trees and plants brought in from  the Romanian mountains. You can also enjoy seeing numerous exotic plants which  were fetched from the botanical gardens in Vienna. People of all ages and  interests spend their free time in the garden since it has cafes, children's  playgrounds and a lake, which is used for rowing in summer and skating in  winter.  This atypical  museum will teach you lots about Romania's regions through a historical tour.  In this spacious outdoor complex, there are more than 60 original houses,  farmsteads, windmills, watermills and churches, most of them dating from the  19th century. One of the biggest attractions for tourists are the earth houses,  which are dug into the ground and covered with thatched (made of dried straw)  roofs. Occasionally, folkloric and crafts festivals are held in this museum.\n",
      "8-Budapest \n",
      "https://www.really-learn-english.com/english-reading-comprehension-budapest.html\n",
      "Budapest, the capital of Hungary, is one of the best kept secrets in Europe. This beautiful city is divided into two towns by the Danube River. The east side is called Buda and the west side is called Pest. Buda is the hilly side and Pest is the flat side.While travelers often think of Paris and London as the must-see cities of Europe, they may overlook the historic Ottoman architecture of Buda, the wide boulevards of Pest, and above all the sweeping views of the wide Danube river. The narrow streets, historic buildings, and spectacular  views make Castle Hill a favorite place to wander on the Pest side of the city.  Visitors can see Buda Castle which was the home of Hungarian kings. Buda Castle  is now the home of the Budapest History Museum and the Hungarian National  Gallery. Although one can view many works of Hungarian art inside the Gallery,  visitors can see important sculptures on the grounds of the castle too. In the  west courtyard, the Matthias Fountain sculpture tells the ancient Hungarian  story of how a young girl fell in love with the strong and brave King Matthias  when he was out hunting. Across from Matthias fountain, a  statue represents Hungary's long history of horse training. The sculpture  shows a huge horse standing up on its back legs as a man tries to  control the animal.Another important  building in the Castle district is Sandor Palace, the residence, or home, of  the president of the Republic. Visitors like to walk by the Palace during the  changing of the guard. The soldiers do a difficult set of marching steps to  change from one group of guards to the next. Castle Hill also includes the main  square of the old town district of Buda. On one side of the square sits  Matthias Church, named after the popular King Matthias. The church dates from  the thirteenth century and was the place where new kings were crowned. Probably  the favorite viewing area in Castle Hill is Fisherman's Bastion. A bastion is a  strong place that can resist attack. The name may come from a group of fishermen  who fought against invaders during the Middle Ages. The fairy tale architecture  includes seven turrets (small pointed towers), statues, fancy balconies, and  wide stone steps going from terrace to terrace. Down below one can see sweeping  views of the river Danube.  The city's most beautiful bridge, the Chain Bridge, crosses  the Danube River and connects the Buda side of the capital city with the Pest  side. The cast iron structure of the bridge gives the bridge its popular name.  Its official name is the Szechenyi Lanchid. Opened in 1849, the Chain Bridge  was the first permanent bridge across the Danube. At the time it was considered  an engineering wonder. Today the Chain Bridge is most famous for its fabulous  views of the city and Danube River. Just like the Brooklyn Bridge has become a  cultural icon in the United States, the Chain Bridge is an important part of  Hungarian culture. During air plane races in Budapest, daring pilots fly upside  down under the bridge. It can also be seen in movies like I Spy and Walking with the  Enemy. Pedestrians, or walkers, are welcome to cross over the bridge and  enjoy the views.Heroes' Square was built in 1896 for the 1000th anniversary  of Hungary. It is the largest and most impressive square in Budapest. It is surrounded  by the Museum of Fine Arts on the left, and the Hall of Art on the right. Heroes'  Square is also a station of the Millennium Underground (the first subway line  in Europe).  The Millennium Monument in the middle of the square was built  to honor the 1000-year-old history of the Hungarians. It rises to a height of 36  meters (118 feet).  This high column is topped with a statue of the archangel  Gabriel, holding a crown in his right hand. According to legend, the archangel  appeared to St. Stephen (the first king of Hungary) in a dream and offered him  the crown of Hungary.  The base of the column is surrounded by seven statues of strong  looking warriors. The statues present the leaders of the Hungarian tribes who settled  their people in the area now known as Hungary.  Behind the column there are statues of famous men from  Hungarian history and additional statues that symbolize War, Peace, Work and  Welfare, and Knowledge and Glory. St. Stephen's Basilica is the largest church in Budapest. It is dedicated to Hungary's first king, St. Stephen. It was built over half a century and completed in 1905. It can hold up to 8,500 people!St. Stephen's Basilica holds impressive classical concerts throughout the year.The towers of the St. Stephen's Basilica reach high to the sky, which make the it one of the highest points on the Pest side of Budapest.Budapest, the \"city of spas,\" has one of the largest natural  hot springs or spa areas in Europe. Going back to Roman times, people soaked in  these warm springs for relaxation and healing purposes. The Romans even built  their regional capital, Aquinim, in this area west of the Danube River so they  could use the hot springs. Some ruins of these Roman baths can still be seen  today. Szechenyi Bath is the most popular spa area. The three outdoor pools and  over ten indoor pools date from the 1920s. The Greek and Roman architecture, or  building style, along with the steamy pools give a feeling of luxury and calm.  Locals and tourists go to swim, soak away their aches and pains, and even play  chess on the floating tables.  The tradition of the café goes back hundreds of years in  Budapest. The popularity of coffee started with the Turks who came to Hungary  in the sixteenth century. By the 1800s there were over 400 coffee houses in  Budapest. Now the tradition continues. The great cafes of the city serve a very  strong espresso coffee in china cups (no paper cups here) to crowds of people  every day. Two of the most famous cafes are Gerbeaud and Café Kavehaz. Gerbeaud  started in 1858 and is now the largest and most traditional coffee house in the  city. Of the many desserts served at Gerbeaud, the sour cherry covered in dark  chocolate gets the most praise. Another famous café, Central Kavehaz, has been  a gathering place for writers, artists, and musicians since the late 1800s. The  inside of Central Kavehaz was restored in 2000 to look like the elegant Viennese  café it was during the Austro-Hungarian Empire. \n",
      "9-Cairo\n",
      "https://www.really-learn-english.com/english-reading-comprehension-cairo.html\n",
      "The official name of Cairo, the capital of  Egypt, is al-Qahirah, which in Arabic  means \"the Conqueror\" or \"the Victorious\". A legend suggests that when this  North African megacity was founded, \"the Conquering Star\" (an-Najm al-Qahir in Arabic), another name for the planet Mars, was  rising in the sky. Such a powerful name suits this inspiring city on the Nile  River. The Al-Azhar Mosque is as old as Cairo. The  then-ruling Fatimid dynasty had ordered its construction and dedicated it in 972.  Already in 989, thirty-five scholars were hired to teach at the mosque, which  makes it the second oldest university which still runs today. The University of  Al-Azhar remained the foremost institution for studying Islamic law and  theology for 1,000 years until it was turned into an independent, non-religious  school in 1961. It is not certain why the mosque is called Al-Azhar. One  explanation could be that azhar is  the masculine form of zahra, which  means \"splendid\". Zahra was also a name often associated with Fatimah, the  daughter of Muhammad, the central figure in Islam. The mosque has seen many  rulers and occupying forces during its long history, some of whom have expanded  it by adding minarets (towers) and gates. On the outskirts of Cairo lies the only  remaining wonder of the Ancient World, the world famous pyramids of Giza. There  are three pyramids which have survived for 4,500 years since they were originally  built as monumental tombs for Egypt's pharaohs (leaders). The ancient Egyptians  believed that their pharaohs became gods after they had died, so these massive  pyramids were supposed to provide them with all the things they might need in the  afterlife (for example, food or gold). The largest one of them, known as the  Great Pyramid, is made of 2.3 million individual stone blocks, each of them  weighing 2.5 to 15 tons. Besides the pyramids, the Giza complex also includes  the Sphinx, an enormous monument of a creature which has the body of a lion and  the head of a pharaoh. The Sphinx represents the Pharaoh Khafre, who ordered  the construction of the second pyramid. We know that no pyramid could have been  built without the tireless work of thousands of workers, we do not know exactly  how many were employed. Herodotus, an ancient Greek historian, reported hearing  that 400,000 people built the Great Pyramid in 20 years. \n",
      "The Saladin Citadel in Cairo was founded  as a fortification in the 12th century on a hill near the city center. It was  built to protect the city from the Crusaders, warriors who wanted to spread  Christianity. Many people and animals lived in the citadel, and they were able  to have enough water supplies thanks to the Well of Joseph, a 280 feet (85  meters) deep well which was connected to the Nile River. Citadel was also the  center of Egyptian government until the 19th century, after which it  was used for military purposes. More specifically, it served as a barrack for  British forces during World War II. Today, it is a popular monument, with  several mosques and museums. The three main mosques were constructed during  different periods, so they are nice locations for everyone who feels curious  about Cairo's history.\n",

Over 30% of the country is forest. And Canada  has 10% of the world's forests! Canada also has more lake area than any other  country in the world. A lake in CanadaCanada is a very young country. Canada only became a country in 1867.  The country celebrated its 150th birthday in July 2017. July 1st is Canada Day.  People all across the country celebrate by wearing red and white. Red and white  are the national colors shown on its flag. Canada was first discovered by the French explorer, Jacques Cartier in  1534. However, people had been living in Canada long before that. Indigenous  people had been living in North America for centuries. Indigenous people still  live in Canada today. Canada's national animal is a beaver! And it has two national  languages, both English and French. However, only two provinces are officially  French speaking, Quebec and New Brunswick. Canada is still strongly tied to the country of England. Like  Australia, Canada celebrates the Queen of England as their Queen too!When many people think of Canada, they think of maple syrup. Did you  know that the Canadian province of Quebec is responsible for 70% of the world's  maple syrup? Maple syrup is a delicious sweet and runny sauce used commonly on  pancakes, waffles, french toast and oatmeal.Historically, indigenous people started producing maple syrup. When  Europeans first came to Canada and met these indigenous people, they adopted  some of their practices, including how to make maple syrup. In July 2013, there was a maple syrup robbery. A group of thieves  stole $18 million worth of maple syrup! Can you believe that? They took 3,000  tons of maple syrup from a warehouse in Quebec. The man in charge was fined  nearly $10 million and is facing 9 years in prison. Maple syrup robbery is a serious crime in Canada! Maple syrup is worth  more than oil!Canada has its own currency. It is the Canadian dollar. If you travel  to Canada, you will hear Canadians use the words \"loonie\" and \"toonie.\" A \"loonie\" is a one dollar coin. It is called a \"loonie\" because there is a loon on one of its faces. A loon is a type of water bird, similar to a goose or a duck. They are commonly found in Canada. Can you guess what a \"toonie\" is? It's  a two dollar coin!Baby Loon riding on mother's backPeople often think of Canada as being very cold. This is true for some  parts of Canada. In Ottawa, the average low temperature in the month of January  is -14.4 degrees Celsius. That may seem very cold to you. But the Yukon is a  northern territory in Canada. Their coldest recorded temperature is -63 degrees  Celsius. It was recorded in 1947. That's almost as cold as planet Mars!Northern Lights over a frozen lake at Yukon Territory, CanadaCanada isn't always cold however. In the summer months, it can get  quite hot. On the west coast of Canada in fact, there are places where it  rarely snows. Instead, in the winter months these areas get lots of rain. The Canadian postal service assigned an official address for Santa  Claus in the North Pole. They even gave him a postal code of H0H 0H0! Every  Christmas, Canadian children send letters to this address. They are all read  and answered by the postal service!The world's largest coin is found in Canada. It is a reproduction of a  nickel. A nickel is a five cent coin. It is located in the province of Ontario  and it measures 9 meters! Canadians love ice hockey and most Canadians play it. Canada holds the  record for the most gold medals ever won at the Winter Olympics. In 2010, the  Winter Olympics were hosted in the Canadian city of Vancouver. Canada won 14  gold medals.  The name \"Canada\" is actually a mistake. Remember Jacques Cartier, the  explorer who discovered Canada? Well, he spoke with indigenous people when he  found Canada. They spoke a different language, and their word for \"village\" was  \"kanata\" or \"canada.\" Cartier thought that this word was the name of where he  was. From this, the country of \"Canada\" was born!Do you know the Netherlands? It is a country in Europe. Well, the  Netherlands and Canada have a very good relationship. In fact, the Netherlands  commonly gives Canada a gift each year of thousands of tulip flowers. In 1943,  a princess from the Netherlands was in Ottawa and about to give birth to her  daughter. But according to their laws, if the baby was born outside of the  Netherlands, she would not be a citizen of the country. So Ottawa turned the  princess' hospital room into official international ground. This means that the  hospital room was now \"international\" territory and not just Canadian. The baby  could be a citizen of the Netherlands. Because of this, Canada and the  Netherlands are very good friends. Sunrise over a tulip field in the NetherlandsAs you've read, Canada  is big and interesting country. If you should every want to visit Canada,  cities like Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver are very big tourist destinations.  You can also go to coastal cities like St. John's or Victoria and spend time  with ocean wildlife. There is something to see and do for everyone in Canada. \n",
      "11-Cats\n",
      "https://www.really-learn-english.com/english-reading-comprehension-cats.html\n",
      "Counting more than half a billion individuals and over 70 different breeds, cats are the world's most popular pets. Even though they are curious animals who like to explore and hunt, cats are also a truly social species. They communicate with humans through mewing, purring or sometimes grunting, and it is possible to even learn cat-specific body language to better understand their needs and wishes.   One of the oldest breeds in the world, the Siamese were introduced to Europe through England as the Royal Cat of Siam (now Thailand). Siamese cats are endlessly curious, and require a lot of attention, so they are good for people who can afford to spend time playing with them. They always seek new hideaways in and around the house, and they even seem to be enjoying watching television. As a breed, Siamese cats are great at learning tricks. They are also eager to show their owners how to do exactly what they want them to do. Being incredibly pretty, the Siamese are frequently portrayed in movies, including some of the most famous animated ones like 'The Aristocats'.Originating from the Indian Ocean coastline, this beautiful cat resembles a lot to the African wild cat. Abyssinians enjoy climbing up to high places, and exploring every corner of the house. Sometimes, they are even called 'Aby-silly-an', because they are so playful. Yet, they are also highly social, so they can be taught to go for walks on a leash – and actually enjoy it – like dogs. Abyssinian cats love to spend time outside and to bird-watch, so they are not a good match for people who are looking for a 'lap cat' - a cat to simply sit on their lap and sleep.Persian cats are probably the most popular cat breed in the world. There are two types of Persian cats: show and traditional. In comparison to the traditional Persian cat, the show cat has more extreme features, such as small ears and a flat nose. Unlike the Abyssinian, Persian cats are typical \"lap cats\", and have a very restful personality. They are not very demanding, and love to cuddle. As such, Persian cats prefer quiet families, but can be adaptable to bigger and noisier environments, too. These cats should be groomed every day since they fur is long. Tabby cats are cats who have lines or spots on their fur. They  are not recognized as a breed, yet they are one of the most common cats. The orange  ones have different features than, for example, grey Tabby cats. This  particular cat inspired the cartoon character Garfield, an orange cat who loves to eat. In real life, orange Tabby  cats also have a tendency to overeat and become very fat. You should be careful  with them, because they are not picky and would eat anything, including baby  food and dog food. Orange tabby cats don't mind sharing the house with other  animals, because it means more food for them.\n",
      "12-Caucasus\n",
      "https://www.really-learn-english.com/english-reading-comprehension-caucasus.html\n",
      "The Caucasus lies on the southern edge of the border between Europe and Asia. This region is defined by the Caucasus Mountains, a mountain chain where Europe's highest mountain, Mount Elbrus, is located. Regarding its size, the Caucasus area extends between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. There are three countries which entirely belong to the Caucasus: Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan. Parts of southern Russia, most notably the federal subjects of Chechnya and Northern Ossetia, are also in the Caucasus. Georgia is one of the countries with a  coast along the Black Sea, and Batumi is its biggest harbor there. Its name  derives from the Greek phrase bathus  limen meaning \"deep harbor\". Today, Batumi is not only the main port city  of Georgia but also one of its major tourist destinations. Batumi's beachfront  and gambling opportunities attract a significant number of tourists from the  region. Although it is not such a large city, Batumi hosts numerous places of  worship, including Orthodox churches, a mosque, and a synagogue. Another  excellent tourist location is the Botanical Garden, which has different sections  with the plants that grow in the Caucasus, as well as in other parts of the  world such as the Himalayas and South America. Of course, visiting Batumi without trying the delicious Georgian cuisine would be unimaginable. Khachapuri, a boat-shaped bread with cheese and eggs, is a must-try.The capital of Armenia, Yerevan, is one of  the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. The birthplace of the  city is considered to be the Erebuni fortress, built in 782 BC. It is also  quite possible that the city was named Yerevan after this fort. As different  languages mixed with each other over the years, Erebuni became Erevan (or  Yerevan). In addition to the remains of the fortress, there are many other  notable landmarks in this old city. Being the oldest Christian nation, Armenia  also has some of the earliest churches. In Yerevan, tourists frequently visit the  Katoghike Tsiranovar church, dating from the 6th century. A  representative of more modern architecture is a massive stairway called the  Cascade, located in the city center. While the exterior of the Cascade consists  of several floors with fountains and sculptures, the inside is used for art  exhibitions. From the top of the Cascade, you can enjoy the view of Mount  Ararat. This mountain located in Turkey is one of the principal symbols of  Armenia.The Caspian Sea defines the eastern border of the  Caucasus. Baku, the largest city in the region and the capital of Azerbaijan,  is located there. The city lies only 92 feet (28 meters) above the sea level,  which makes it the lowest lying capital in the world. Being a coastal city, it  is renowned for very harsh winds. This is also the reason why many people call  it the \"City of Winds\". In fact, the Persian name of the city, Bad-kube means \"wind-pounded city\". The  Old City of Baku serves to tell stories about the city's antiquity. It is a  rather small area that can be seen on foot in only one day. This is where the  Palace of the Shirvan Shahs, a 15th century complex with the palace,  a mosque, and a bathhouse, is located. Another important historical place is  the Maiden's Tower (Giz Qalasi), which was used as a fortification for defense,  but also as an astronomical observatory. Boat tours of Baku's coastline are  another great way to get to know the city.The highest point on Mount Elbrus is at  18,510 feet (5,642 meters), which makes is the tenth highest peak in the world.  Located in southern Russia, Elbrus is actually a dormant volcano. The last  eruption took place almost 2,000 years ago. The difference between the two  summits (the east and the west) is only 3.2 feet (1 meter). While the east  summit was first ascended in 1829, the west summit was only conquered in 1874  by a British expedition. The name Elbrus derives from Alborz, the name of a  mountain range in Iran. Etymology suggests that the word could mean \"high,  tall\". Nowadays, Mount Elbrus attracts adventurous tourists. With the help of  cable cars, the ascent to Elbrus is not too demanding and can be completed in a  day. The Elbrus Race is a very popular event, where the fittest of all  participants race all the way to the summit. Other options such as a mountain  marathon or an 11km long race are also available. \n",

      "13-The Coldest Places Where People Live\n",
      "https://www.really-learn-english.com/english-reading-comprehension-coldest-places.html\n",
      "Humans have inhabited nearly every corner of the world. Even with the great migration flows that occur today, many people keep living in some notoriously cold towns and cities. In fact, the population in many of them continues to increase, due to the wealth of natural resources that many such places possess. All of the coldest permanently inhabited places on Earth tend to be close to the Arctic Circle, the area where the North Pole is. The town of Verkhoyansk, located on the Yana River near the Arctic Circle, is not only famous as one of the coldest places in the world. This little town also holds the world record for the greatest temperature range, amounting to the incredible 189 °F (105 °C): from -89.7 °F (-67.6 °C) to  98 °F (37 °C).The lowest temperature was recorded in 1892, and it was −89.7 °F (−67.6 °C). This was the lowest temperature in the entire world until the village of Oymyakon, named after the Oymyakon River, reached −89.9 °F (−67.7 °C). Oymyakon and Verkhoyansk are located in the same region of Russia, the so-called Sakha Republic. They are 391 miles (629 km) away from each other. The only place on Earth which has lower temperatures than these two Russian towns is Antarctica (the South Pole); however, this area is not permanently inhabited by people. What is surprising is that, in the summer, the weather in these two towns can be incredibly warm (over 86 °F/30 °C), which makes them the only places with such vast temperature ranges. In spite of these enormous variations and a constant below freezing temperature that lasts for months, people continue to live in Verkhoyansk and Oymyakon. Their populations are 1,000 and 500 people respectively.\n",
      "  There is another city in the Sakha Republic worth mentioning. Yakutsk, the capital of the republic and a major port on the Lena River, is often declared the coldest city in the world. Some 270,000 people live in this city located only 280 miles (450 km) south of the Arctic Circle. It was named after the Yakutsk people who migrated there in the 13th and 14th century from various parts of Siberia, an extensive, cold region in the north of the country. When significant reserves of gold and minerals were discovered in the late 19th century, more people moved to Yakutsk, and it grew into a major city. Today, Yakutsk is one of the leading suppliers of diamonds, so its population keeps increasing despite low temperatures. The lowest temperature, amounting to −83.9 °F (−64.4 °C), was recorded in 1891. Summers in Yakutsk can be quite warm, with lots of rain.Barrow, the northernmost cities in the  United States, is at the same time one of the coldest cities on Earth. The site  of the city has been continuously inhabited for over 1,500 years by the indigenous  Inuit people (a group called Iñupiat). Its original, and since 2016 the  official name is Utqiagvik. It  derives from the Iñupiat word utqiq,  which can be interpreted as \"potato\" or \"gathering of wild roots\". Today,  Barrow has merely 5,000 residents, not all of whom are Iñupiat. Many  non-indigenous residents of the city found it hard to pronounce its traditional  name, so they renamed it to Barrow. Such a name was chosen because of Point  Barrow, the northernmost point of the entire United States. In Barrow, the  temperatures drop below freezing in October and stay that low until May. The  lowest temperature was −56 °F (−49 °C), recorded in 1924. When you are in  Barrow, it is very likely you will spot a whale swimming in the ocean.\n",
      "The Northwest Territories in Canada occupy  a vast land area of 442,000 square miles (1,144,000 km2); however,  only 40,000 people live there. Half of them are stationed in the largest  community and the only city in the Northwest Territories called Yellowknife.  This city is found on the west side of Yellowknife Bay. Both the community and  the bay were named after a local Native American (or First Nation, as they are  called in Canada) tribe. Although small, Yellowknife is very ethnically mixed,  and there are at least five commonly spoken languages. In one of the local  languages, the Dogrib language, Yellowknife is called So`mbak'è, meaning \"where the money is\". Besides the  abundance of gold and diamonds, Yellowknife is renowned for its low  temperatures. In 1947, the record low temperature of −60 °F (−51.2 °C) was registered.  In winter months, the residents of Yellowknife get only five hours of daylight.  Later during the year in June, a day can last for twenty hours.Ulaanbaatar is the capital of Mongolia and  a place where nearly half of the country's population lives. In 1639, a nomadic  Buddhist monastery was founded on the site of Ulaanbaatar, and this event is  considered to be the birth of the city. During its long history, the city had  several different names. When Mongolia changed its government regime in 1924,  the capital was renamed to Ulaanbaatar, which literally means \"Red Hero\" in the  Mongol language. What contributes to the low temperatures in Ulaanbaatar is its  location. The city lies at about 4,430 feet (1,350 meters) above sea level, at  the foot of the Bogd Khan Uul Mountain. The coldest temperatures can be  expected in January and February, where, on average, they drop down between  −32.8 and −40.0 °F (−36 and −40 °C). With such low temperatures, Ulaanbaatar is  considered the coldest capital in the world.\n",

      "See  Types of Cookies and  Their Special Names, Cookies from Around the World, Part 1In addition to making people happy with their delicious taste, cookies often have very interesting stories to tell. Studying the etymology of a specific cookie's name and reading about how it came about can also tell us a lot about the history, customs and beliefs of a particular culture where the cookie is invented or commonly eaten. This surely makes everyone love cookies even more. This  delicious sweet roll filled with fig paste can be found around the world,  although it originates from ancient Egypt. Figs were first used as snacks in  Anatolia, today's Turkey, from where they were traded by sailors to other  countries, including Egypt. There, fig rolls were developed in order to  preserve figs in the pastry and store them for long-distance journeys. American  company Fig Newton started with mass production of this cookie in 1892, as many  physicians believed that daily intakes of cookies and fruit could solve many  digestion problems and illnesses. (Most cookies, however, like most processed foods, are really less healthy than natural foods like fruit and vegetables.)The fortune  cookie might not be the healthiest cookie ever, consisting mainly of flour,  sugar and vanilla, but is definitely one of the most beloved ones. Contrary to  the popular belief, these cookies were not invented in China, but in the U.S.,  inspired by Japanese cookies called omikuji.  Several people of Japanese origin living in the Los Angeles area made  simultaneous claims that they were the first ones to make these cookies which  contain a piece of paper, the so-called fortune (a person's future) or advice,  inside. The paper is supposed to make a prophecy to the person eating the  cookie.Shortbread is a thick cookie made of flour, sugar, and a lot of  shortening. Shortening is fat (such as butter) that is used in baking.The popular caramel shortbread   cookie builds upon the classic shortbread cookie base with its soft caramel  filling and a chocolate topping. It is commonly known as \"millionaire  shortbread\" because of the rich variety of ingredients it includes. Although it  originates from Scotland, it became popular when it appeared in Australian  cookbooks in the 1970s. When it first appeared in Scotland, shortbread was very  expensive so it was reserved for special occasions such as Hogmanay (Scottish  New Year's Eve). However, nowadays its ingredients are not pricy so everyone  can enjoy it.Originating  from the 9th century Italian monasteries, macaroons are one of the  oldest cookies in the world. In Italian, \"maccarone\" means \"paste\", which  refers to the almond paste which is macaroon's main and most original  ingredient. In Greek, the first part of the word \"makar\" means \"blessed,  happy\", which perhaps explains why macaroons are so popular. Made from ground  almonds, coconut and other nuts, macaroons have no flour or leavening (a substance, especially yeast, that is used to make dough rise and become light). For this  reason, they were adopted by Italian Jews as a perfect snack during the  eight-day long Passover holiday.There is  another famous cookie with a very similar name. Made from egg whites, sugar and  food coloring, two macaron cookies are joined with jam filing or ganache (chocolate and cream). The name  has the same origin as the macaroon cookie, but a slightly different history.  First produced in Venice, Italy, macarons spread across Europe in the 18th  century when two nuns seeking asylum in France baked and sold macarons in order  to pay for their accommodation. Nowadays, they are one of the more expensive  cookies, and usually come in many different colors.Several  legends about a female character called Madeleine are attached to this  delicious French cookie. While some say she was the cook of King Stanislaus (the last King of Poland), other  believe she was a pilgrim who brought the recipe back to France from one of her  journeys. In any case, madeleines were first prepared in the 18th  century, as metal molds were introduced to European baking. The madeleine is a  small sponge cake made with ground nuts and lemon zest. Thanks to special  madeleine pans, this cake traditionally comes in the shape of a shell.A petit four  is a small bite-sized decorated cake or cookie. The name is French, meaning \"small oven\" (as historically bakers would use the lower setting on their ovens to cook delicate cookies and cakes). Petit fours can usually be eaten in one or two bites and are traditionally served with afternoon tea or after a fancy meal.See  Types of Cookies and  Their Special Names, Cookies from Around the World, Part 1\n",

      "Cookies (or biscuits, as the Brits call them) are  everyone's favorite snack. Usually made from the simple base of flour, sugar  and oil, cookies are customized and made absolutely delicious by adding  chocolate chips, nuts or raisins. They can be found everywhere – prepacked at a  local supermarket, homemade, in a local bakery, bought at a vending machine or  brought in by someone at school or work. With such immense cookie diversity, it  is hard to pick your favorite, and each country has its own special cookie tradition! The alfajor cookie traveled  across the world from the Middle East, with written records about it dating  back to the 8th century. From there, alfajores reached Spain and are  now commonly found in many South American countries. The word alfajor stems from the Arabic word al-hasú, which means filled or stuffed. Traditional Spanish alfajores  are made from two round cookies and dulce  de leche (a milk-based sweet filling), but some more modern variations are  coated in dark or white chocolate. These sandwich cookies are the most common  snack for both schoolchildren and adults in Argentina, which is its largest  consumer in the world.In Italy,  the most popular cookies are biscotti – almond cookies originating from the  Italian city of Prato. In the local language, \"biscotti\" is the plural form of  \"biscotto\", a word originating from \"biscoctus\", which in Latin means \"twice  baked\". Traditionally, biscotti are baked twice so they can be very dry and  stored for a long period of time. Because of this trait, biscotti were  especially useful for travelers and soldiers. In fact, biscotti were a staple  food of the Roman Legions, the largest unit of the great Roman army. Also known  as cantuccini, these dry cookies are  often served as an after-dinner dessert with a drink – in Italy, they come with  wine, whereas in other parts of the world coffee and tea are more common.The famous chocolate chip cookie is an American invention, made for the first time in 1938 by Ruth Graves Wakefield, an American  chef who decided to add a chopped up chocolate bar into the standard cookie dough,  hoping the chocolate would not melt so that the cookie could stay crunchy. The  cookie was originally named \"Toll House\", after the inn where she worked. After  she published a recipe book, this cookie became a favorite dessert in many  American homes. During World War II, many soldiers sent letters back home  asking their families to ship them some Toll House cookies, which is really  what made this cookie the national cookie of the United States. Some popular  variations include adding peanut butter, macadamia nuts or simply more melted  chocolate.The  hamantash (or hamantasche) cookie,  traditionally made by Ashkenazi Jewish communities, has a long history. It is  associated with  Purim, a Jewish holiday celebrated in Febuary or March to commemorate how the Jewish people were saved from a massacre planned by a Persian minister called  Evil Haman. That's why another name for this cookie is \"Haman's ear\". The cookie's triangular shape is supposed to  represent the ears of Haman (oznei Haman in Hebrew), symbolizing triumph over this  particular enemy. This special shape of the cookie is reached when the sides of  the circular dough are folded, and a filling, traditionally made of poppy seed,  but also apricot or dates, is added to the center.See  Types of Cookies and  Their Special Names, Cookies from Around the World, Part 2\n",

      "16-Interesting Dining Manners in Different Cultures\n",
      "https://www.really-learn-english.com/english-reading-comprehension-dining-manners.html\n",
      "Around the world, people gather to eat  lunch or dinner. Every culture has developed this social ritual in different  ways, so today there are certain rules that need to be respected while eating –  for example, how to use utensils (knife, fork, spoon) correctly or when to ask  to be served. We call them dining or  table manners. These rules differ from one culture to another, so what is  considered to be polite in one society can be seen as very rude somewhere else! When in France, you might be advised to  always rest your wrists or forearms (but not elbows) on the table while you are  not using utensils to eat. Keeping your hands under the table where nobody can  see them is considered a bad dining manner. In many other countries in Europe  and North America, \"hands on the table\" is one of the basic dining rules,  particularly reiterated to children. Why is that? Some people suggest this  tradition started because people were afraid of what other people might be  doing under the table, like holding a weapon.  If you find yourself in Spain during the  summer, you will notice that many shops are closed in the early afternoon, even  on a regular work day. The reason they are closed is siesta, a short nap people take after lunch. The word siesta, meaning \"nap\" in Spanish,  derives from the Latin word sexta,  meaning the sixth hour (counting from the dawn), which explains why siesta is  usually taken around noon. This particular dining ritual can be explained by  the very high temperatures during the summer, and the great amount of food a  typical midday meal in Spain includes. These two together make people very  sleepy, so they made it a nation-wide acceptable habit to take a break from  work in the middle of the day and get some rest.  While in most European cultures making any  noise while drinking or chewing is considered to be very rude, in places like  Japan and China those who slurp their soups have good dining manners. In other  words, slurping your soup or noodles very loudly sends a message to the chef or  the host that the food is delicious. The more loudly you slurp it, the more  appreciation for the meal you show. If by any chance you forget to do it, the  cook could be very offended or hurt thinking that you did not enjoy their meal!  Traditionally, Ethiopian food is eaten  with hands, usually from a large communal plate. Several delicious meals are  put together in a plate with some injera,  a flat Ethiopian bread, and the guests sit around it. The proper way to eat  Ethiopian food is to tear off a piece of the bread, grab some food that is  close to you with it, and put it in your mouth. Because you are touching the  food with your hands, make sure that you always wash them before and after the  meal. The left hand is considered unclean, so it is advisable and polite to  only use your right hand to eat.Italian  cuisine is known for using a great variety of cheese in large quantities.  Italian pizzas and pastas are particularly rich in cheese. In an Italian  restaurant anywhere in the world, the parmesan cheese might even be freshly  grated in front of you on your plate. However, unless cheese is offered to you,  you should not ask for extra cheese for a dish like pizza which already has a  lot of cheese. Such an act is considered to be an insult to the cook, so most  waiters will simply refuse to bring more cheese. Another cheese-related rule in  Italy applies to seafood – adding cheese to a seafood pasta is unimaginable  according to traditional dining manners, so it is best you avoid it.\n",

      "https://www.really-learn-english.com/english-reading-comprehension-dogs-2.html\n",
      "See Dogs Our Loyal Friends, Part 1See Dogs Our Loyal Friends, Part 3Each dog breed has a set of special  characteristics which developed throughout their long history of being humans'  best friends. Some dogs require a lot of exercise each day, other prefer to  stay indoors and nap. It is important to know more about them so that our  lovely pets can have the best possible care. These small dogs are believed to originate  from the Mediterranean island of Malta. In English, the Maltese has also been  known as the \"Roman Ladies' Dog\", because of its size and long hair. Their  silky white hair should be groomed regularly. It can fall all the way to the  floor or be kept shorter. The Maltese is not just pretty, but also very  intelligent. They are perfect for people living in smaller apartments. Since  these dogs have had human friends for many years, they require a lot of  attention. They can become very anxious when separated from their humans – even  if it is just for a few hours. What's more, their stomachs are very sensitive,  so they can be picky eaters.  In Japanese, inu means \"dog\", while shiba can be translated as \"brushwood\" (a tree with red leaves) or \"small\". These  words perfectly describe this dog, which has beautiful orange and red hair, and  looks like a wolf, but it is much smaller. Shiba Inu is used to working in  mountainous areas and is a very good hunter. They were originally bred to hunt  birds and even wild pigs, so today they remain very athletic. They move  quickly and prefer to be active all day. These lovely dogs are a bit selfish,  as they like to guard their belongings, such as toys and food. Yet, if people  treat them with respect, they will be completely loyal and loving. Born to be  hunters, they will use every opportunity to chase smaller animals – even cats!  Originating from the now extinct English  white terrier, Jack Russel was named after John Russell, a priest who bred them  to hunt foxes. There are several breeds named after this man, whose nickname  was Jack, all of them being small with white and brown bodies. Jack Russell  terriers have a very specific temper – they are one of the liveliest and most  active dog breeds, which is why they are normally recommended to more  experienced dog owners who can train them properly. Because they are fearless,  very energetic and small enough to be portable, these dogs are favorite among  animal trainers who frequently use them in movies and on television.  These giant dogs can weigh up to 260  pounds (120 kg), yet they are very friendly and loving. Coming from the western  Alps in Switzerland and Italy, Saint Bernards were bred to be working dogs in  the mountains. Very quickly, they became famous for rescuing many people from  avalanches, rapidly falling snow and ice. They were named after two hospitals  located on the Great and Little Saint Bernard Passes in the Alps. Saint Bernard  dogs require daily walks, but not excess training. Although big, they are  perfectly happy indoors, and constantly need human companion. Saint Bernard  dogs are very friendly to children and good to have around the house, although  they can sometimes accidentally knock something over with their heavy tails.In Welsh, corgi means \"dwarf dog\", a good name for this short but long  dog with funny ears. Despite their relatively small size, corgis have  historically been use to herd cattle. Nowadays, there are two kinds of Welsh  corgis – the Pembroke and the Cardigan. Even though they look very similar at  first glance, the biggest difference is that the Cardigan has a longer tail.  Corgis require a lot of exercise to be healthy, especially since they are prone  to overeating, which can cause serious health problems. They also love to bark  – at anything and anyone! Queen Elizabeth II, the reigning monarch of the  United Kingdom, has owned more than 30 corgis. See Dogs Our Loyal Friends, Part 1See Dogs Our Loyal Friends, Part 3\n",

      "See Dogs Our Loyal Friends, Part 1See Dogs Our Loyal Friends, Part 2Nobody knows exactly how many dogs there are in the world. Yet, one thing is for certain – the number keeps increasing. In the United States, more than 80 million dogs live as pets. In the European Union, the total dog population has gone up by six million in only a couple of years. Because dogs make our daily lives so much better, it is possible that soon there will be as many dogs as there are humans. The Golden Retriever is one the most  popular pets around the world. People love these large yellow dogs because they  are children's best friends. They are good-natured and love playing. The name \"'Retriever\" was given to them because they were good at retrieving shot games  (animals that people hunt like birds or ducks) undamaged while hunting. These dogs simply love water – take  them for a swim and see how much they enjoy it. Because they are so friendly to  everyone, they should not be relied on for guarding. Yet, the Golden Retriever  is commonly employed as a guide dog for the blind. They have recently been  labeled as therapy dogs – spending  time with them helps those who are ill or recovering from trauma.  Poodles are grouped in three different categories based on their size. Standard poodles are the largest, and they can be up to 24 inches (60cm) tall. Miniature poodles are between 11 and 14 inches (28-35 cm) tall, whereas the smallest ones, called Toy poodles, are usually around 10 inches (25 cm). Their elegant hair  requires professional grooming every few weeks. Due to their smaller size and  long curly hair, they are not taken for hunters or guards. Still, the poodle is  the second most intelligent dog breed of all, ranking just behind the Border  Collie. They frequently win dog competitions in all different disciplines.  Being so clever, poodles love to learn and train, so they should not be left  alone and bored. The place of their origin is still disputed. Some say they  came from Germany, but others believe their French name Caniche (from cane meaning female duck in French)  means they were trained for duck hunting in France.   The spaniel is an old dog breed, mentioned  for the first time in the 14th century French books. The name  \"cocker\" was added much later when these dogs were trained to hunt woodcock birds  in the United Kingdom, and later in the United States, too. Today, their small  size, long ears and cute faces lead many people to believe they could only ever  be companion dogs. Yet, they are still very capable of bird hunting. Cocker  spaniels love their humans and always want to make them happy. This breed  became really popular when the \"Lady and the Tramp\" Disney movie came out in  1955. It is a story about Lady, a house pet Cocker, and Tramp, a stray dog, who  fell in love and had many puppies.  The Shih Tzu is a toy dog breed, weighing  merely 10-19 pounds. Their bodies are covered with long fur, which is often braided  or decorated for shows. It is believed that the Shih Tzu is one of the most  ancient breeds, having first appeared in China and Tibet. In Chinese, their  name means \"lion dog\", or \"little lion\". However, the Shih Tzu has nothing to  do with lions, except maybe for the mane around its head. Giving the Shih Tzu  proper care includes having them stay in air-conditioned rooms over the summer  because they can often have breathing problems. Don't be surprised if you hear  your Shih Tzu snore like a human – that's quite normal for them.  The Boxer is a medium-sized dog developed  from the now extinct Bullenbeisser in the 19th century Germany. Of  course, these dogs were never used for boxing, but only for hunting. One of the  possible reasons they are called Boxers is because it has been noticed that,  while playing, they like to stand on their back legs and pretend to be \"boxing\"  with their front paws. They are large and quite strong, but they aren't really  outdoors dogs. They have very flat faces and short noses, which makes them feel  uncomfortable when the weather is too warm or cold. Even though they can be  hostile to other dogs, Boxers are actually very cheerful and get excited very  easily. They will make sure to show you that with lots of jumping whenever they  are greeting you.See Dogs Our Loyal Friends, Part 1See Dogs Our Loyal Friends, Part 2\n",

      "Dogs have been around humans for many years – they were the first species to be domesticated. For over 1000 years, humans have been breeding dogs to have specific physical attributes or behaviors. This is why today there are more than 330 different breeds of dogs. Some are even smaller than cats, while others, like the English Mastiff, are much bigger than humans. Nowadays, beagles are popular pets,  although they were originally bred for hunting, especially for tracking rabbits.  Because they are excellent scent hounds (dogs with particularly good and sensitive noses), beagles are also employed to  detect prohibited food imports. Besides having an expert nose, the beagle is very  active and fun loving. It is rather difficult to housetrain them, and it can  even be dangerous to leave them alone. They get bored very easily, so it is  very likely they will start howling and digging around if they are alone. All  in all, the brown and white beagle with floppy ears is an independent and  stubborn dog, yet friendly to everyone and so easy to love.  The unique wolf-like looks of this  beautiful breed make the husky a very popular pet. There are different kinds of  huskies, but most often they will be either black or grey, and sometimes red. Huskies  often have sky blue eyes. This breed is commonly used for sledding, whereby  several dogs pull a sled to ease the travel in cold areas covered with snow. Of  course, huskies can be kept as pets in places that are not so cold, although it  is recommended to still keep them very active. Because they are very curious,  they can be taken on longer hiking trips. Even though they are quite big, these  dogs are friendly and perfect for young children.  The tiny, fluffy Pomeranian is one of the  breeds which were made popular by the royalty. In the United Kingdom, Queen  Victoria was fond of this particular dog. They were once large sled dogs, but have  constantly been bred to be smaller. Nowadays, they weigh only three to seven  pounds. But, the size should not fool you – the Pomeranian is not very dog-friendly,  and is known to have the courage to attack much larger dogs. They also have a  very loud bark, and will always notify you when someone new enters the house.  Warm weather bothers them, so they should be kept indoors.  The skinny Greyhound has been particularly  bred for racing. Their strong legs and flexible spine help them run 40 miles  (64 km) per hour on average. Today, much awareness has been raised about all  the retired and abandoned Greyhounds, which is why they have become a popular  family pet. Greyhounds are believed to be one of the most ancient breeds,  possibly originating from Egypt. They have very thin furs, so they require  extra clothing when the weather is cold or rainy. Even though they love to run  fast and chase squirrels, greyhounds are also very good at napping and being  lazy.  These yellow and black dogs are a  relatively recent breed. Their origin dates to 1899, when the Germans bred this  dog to look after sheep. Over the years, their intelligence and obedience were  noted, so they have been the preferred breed for military and police roles.  Since they are used as working dogs, they require solid training even as pets –  daily exercise, such as throwing a Frisbee or jogging is a must. The German  Shepherd is a great watchdog and can be left outside to keep guard. Yet, they  also get bored when they are alone for too long, and simply love spending time  with the family.See Dogs Our Loyal Friends, Part 2See Dogs Our Loyal Friends, Part 3\n",

      "Dublin is the capital and largest city of Ireland. The city lies on the eastern coast of the island of Ireland, at the mouth of the River Liffey. It has been Ireland's most important city for almost a thousand years. It is the heart of political, economic, and cultural life in Ireland. The name Dublin comes from the Irish language word Dubhlinn, meaning \"dark pool\". This pool  is located at the point where the River Poddle meets the River Liffey. This  site is now part of the gardens of Dublin Castle.   Trinity College is the oldest and most prestigious university in  Ireland. It has been at the heart of academic life in Dublin since being  founded in 1592. The university has a close relationship with the universities  of Oxford and Cambridge in England. This means that a graduate of any one of  these universities can be granted a degree at any of the others, without having  to take any further exams. Trinity College is located on College Green,  opposite the Irish Houses of Parliament. Its grounds cover over 47 acres  (190,000 square meters). The Library of Trinity College contains some of  Ireland's greatest historical treasures. These include the beautiful Book of  Kells. This manuscript dates back to the 9th century CE. It is most  famous for its colorful illustrations of stories from the Bible. Dublin Castle was the seat  of English and British government in Ireland from the 13th century  until 1921. Until this date it was the main symbol of British power over  Ireland. In December 1921 the complex was handed over to the new Provisional  Government of Ireland. It now hosts the swearing in ceremony of each President  of Ireland. The castle is used to host official state visits. It also hosts  important national and international conferences and events. Visitors can  access the Castle's state apartments, which are open to the public. The castle  complex also houses the museum to the Garda, the Irish police service. St Stephen's Green is the  most famous public park in Dublin. The park was built as a place for local wealthy  residents to relax in during the late 17th and 18th  centuries. In 1877, the park was opened to the general public for the first  time. The park was occupied by soldiers belonging to the Irish Citizen Army  during the Easter Rising of 1916. After Ireland gained its independence, the  statues of British Kings and noblemen in the park were replaced with statues of  Irish heroes like the writers James Joyce and Thomas Kettle. The National Museum of  Ireland is the country's leading museum of history, archeology, art, and  culture. It was established in 1877 to try and prevent Irish history from being  forgotten under British rule. It is spread across three different sites within  Dublin. The Archeology department on Kildare Street displays treasures  including the Tara Brooch. This piece of jewelry dates back to the 7th  century CE. The Decorative Arts and History section of the museum is kept at  the Collins Barracks building. It contains furniture, costumes, and ceramics  from the last 100 years of Irish history. The Natural History section on  Merrion Street houses examples of animals from around the world.\n",

      "https://www.really-learn-english.com/english-reading-comprehension-flamenco-dresses.html\n",
      "What do you know about Spanish culture? Maybe when you think about Spain, one picture comes to mind. It is probably a Flamenco Dress! Flamenco dresses are outfits worn by women at festivals throughout the country.  Flamenco Dresses are typically very bright colored. They may be made  of fabric with different patterns, like polka-dots. Usually, the colors in a  flamenco dress are either black, red or white. They are usually form-fitting,  meaning it hugs the body of the person wearing it. They often have ruffles  along the skirt and the sleeve. Flamenco dresses are  often worn by dancers at festivals. Therefore, their style has to allow lots of  body movement. For dancers, the skirts are designed so they are less tight  around the dancer's legs. In Spanish, the  flamenco dress is called \"traje de flamenca.\" Flamenco dresses came to Spain  through Romani women. Romani people are commonly referred to as \"gypsies.\" They  were people who moved around a lot and were sometimes looked down upon by  others because of their nomadic culture.These Romani women  came into Spain and went to different fairs where farmed goods and animals were  sold. They came with their husbands, wearing dresses they had made themselves.  They often took different fabrics from other clothes and things and hand sewed  them together. They added ruffles and details to these dresses to make their  plain fabrics more pretty. These dresses were ruffled and colorful, similar to  the flamenco dress that we know now. This style was  adopted from the Romani women. The dresses became very popular among Spanish  women and soon became the official outfit of the April fair in Seville, Spain. The adoption of the flamenco dress was a  way to overcome divisions in social class. While the Romani, low class women of  Spain were looked down up, their outfits were adopted. It mixed women and lower  families into the main culture of Spain. And it smoothed the divisions between  them.  Soon after, the traditional \"Flamenco\"  dance and music became an art form in the country. The dance usually involves  lots of fast foot and arm movements. Elegant skirts and ruffled arms in the  dresses emphasised the movements of the dance. It helped show emotion in the dancer.  As flamenco music and dancing became an iconic part of Spanish culture, the  dress became a part of it too. Now, it is the image that we have around the  world for Spanish festivals. Men also have a traditional flamenco  outfits but it is not as iconic as the dress. It usually includes black pants  and a white shirt under a black vest or coat. Both male and female flamenco  dancers wear heeled shoes to showcase the sound. They often put nails in the  soles to add sounds when dancing and tapping their feet. The styles of the  dress has changed with fashion. Gradually, dresses became shorter and shorter  as modern fashion did too. Sleeves became longer. And as normal fashion became  more simple and streamlined, so did flamenco dresses. Now, you can commonly  find two piece dresses. These come with a top, and a separate skirt. This is  reflective of changes in modern fashion. Flamenco dresses are now rarely worn  everyday. Instead, they are commonly worn during big Spanish holidays, religious  celebrations and pilgrimages. The popularity of  Flamenco dresses made an industry. You can easily buy a flamenco dress in  Spain. Many people still like to create their own though. Making your own  flamenco dress can save you money and also allow you to be creative!There are also  accessories to the dress that need to be included to complete the outfit. The  flamenco dress is usually accompanied by heels, a shawl, a decorated hair comb,  earrings and other jewelry. The popular singer,  Madonna, wore a flamenco dress in a music video in 1987. And many big fashion  designers have used flamenco dresses to influence their own designs. There is  also an International Flamenco Fashion Show in Seville, Spain each year. This show  is a very big event in the country and an important part of the flamenco  culture in Spain. If you take a look at popular wedding dress designs in  today's fashion, you can see that flamenco dresses have influenced their  design. Tight skirts and extravagant ruffles show its influence in today's  fashion, especially in wedding dress design. Also, extravagant sleeves in  dresses showcase this influence too!Dressing in  traditional clothes is a very big part of travelling. It can be quite a fun  activity too! Are you planning on travelling to Spain? Do you want to wear a  flamenco dress while you are there? \n",

      "Take a careful look at the following images – do you recognize any of these beautiful natural places? Read the brief hints above the image, and good luck! This place is part of an area which is as large as China or the United States. The weather is very hot, yet surprisingly, the temperature drops at night. Do you know where it is?Answer: Tassili n'Ajjer, the Sahara, Algeria.Spreading all across North Africa, Sahara  is the largest hot desert in the world. Its borders are the Red Sea in the  east, the Mediterranean Sea in the north, and the Atlantic Ocean in the west.  In Arabic, sahara means \"deserts\".  People have lived on the more fertile edges of the Sahara for thousands of  years. The desert used to be much wetter and, for this reason, richer in animal  and plant life. Fossils and 12,000 years old rock art formations found in  Tassili n'Ajjer serve as a proof. Tassili n'Ajjer is in fact a large sandstone  rock formation, composed of more than 300 arches, pillars, and steep cliffs.  Several endangered plant species unique to the region can be found here.  It looks like a really cold place, yet it is situated in a warm, southern country. The place is particularly famous for its special animal visitors which come once a year. Do you have any clue where this place is?Answer: Argentino Lake, Patagonia, Argentina.Located within the Los Glaciares National  Park, Lake Argentino is the biggest freshwater lake in Argentina. Its waters  flow to the Atlantic Ocean through a river, and are known for large glaciers.  This beautiful lake is located in the region of Patagonia, which comprises the  entire southern section of the South American continent. Its name derives from  the word patagón, first used Ferdinand  Magellan, a Portuguese explorer, to describe the native people of that region.  Being near to the South Pole, Patagonia in fact has a very cold climate. That  said, Patagonia is home to several types of penguins. The most common are the  Magellanic, named after the same explorer who saw them there in 1520. They  usually arrive at the Patagonian coast in September and stay until March to  breed.The cliffs surrounding the shallow blue waters make up this charming landscape, difficult to find anywhere else in the world. You can visit it in the summer, or in the winter - it will still be warm enough to swim. Can you guess where it is?Answer: Railay Beach, Krabi, Thailand.Krabi is a true gem of Thailand. This  province consists a long white sand coastline, a jungle, and more than 200 small  islands. This place is warm all year long, although it is subject to the rainy  season which lasts for six months. Accessible only by boat, Railay is a small  peninsula near the city of Krabi. The Railay beach is famous for the large  cliffs which surround it. For a long time, these cliffs have been attracting  adventurous rock climbers. There are no roads, cars or city noises, so Railay  is a very cut off location. Tourists can go to Railay to relax on the beach and  go on rock climbing tours.It looks like it is covered in snow, yet it is warm enough you could swim in one of the springs. Very close behind it, there are ruins of an ancient city. Where could that be?Answer: Pamukkale, Turkey.In Turkish, pammuk kale means \"cotton castle\", however, this purely white  natural site is not made of cotton. From afar, Pamukkale looks like it is the  only spot covered in snow in the entire region, but what makes it white is  actually travertine, a mineral. Natural pools with hot water are spread out all  over Pamukkale. The underground volcanic activity keeps the water hot at all times.  The visitors were once free to relax in these hot water springs, however,  nearly all of them are now they are closed for bathing due to pollution. The  hill of Pammukale hides another secret – behind it, there are a well-preserved  theater and other remnants of the ancient Greco-Roman city of Hierapolis.Facing the ocean, these green cliffs add to the great beauty of the isolated region, and the country they are located in. This is one of the largest countries in the world, yet relatively few people live in it. Which one is it?Answer: St. Mary's Cape, Newfoundland, Canada.The Canadian island of Newfoundland has many  capes. St. Mary's Cape is known for its wildlife reserve, being home to one of  the largest seabird colonies on the island. Tens of thousands of different  kinds of birds can be found all over this small place. Newfoundland, located on  the southeastern edge of Canada, was first visited by an Icelandic Viking in  the 11th century, and only discovered by European explorers in the  late 15th century. The island is also Britain's oldest colony,  having been claimed by Sir Humphrey Gilbert in 1583. Today, native species like  the Newfoundland beaver and black bear enjoy this wonderful island.\n",

      "  There are so many natural places – numerous mountains, rivers and islands, yet each of them looks so unique. Can you recognize where some of these wonders of nature are simply by looking at the image?   This 100 million year-old rock formation extends to 3,000 feet (900 meters) above the ground. It is located in a mountainous area, yet not too far away from the ocean. Where do you think that could be?Answer: El Capitan, Yosemite National Park, the United States of America.The  El Capitan cliff is found on the north side of Yosemite Valley in California.  The name, given to it in 1851, means \"the chief\" in Spanish. El Cap, as it is  popularly called, attracts many rock climbers who feel challenged by how flat  the cliff is. For the longest time, people thought El Cap was impossible to  climb until three climbers managed to do it in 1958. They used special tactics  to climb the rock in 47 days. Things changed since then because in 2017, Alex  Honnold completed the first ever ascent to El Capitan without any protective  equipment in only 4 hours.   These ruins of an ancient city are located in a very green and hilly area. Lovely animals called lamas like to visit this place. Could it be somewhere in the Americas, or is it in Europe?Answer: Machu Picchu, Peru.Lying  at 8,000 feet (2, 430 meters) above the ground, Machu Picchu is known as The  Lost City of the Incas, the indigenous people of South America. Archaeologists  believe that the Incas started building this glorious city around 1430, but  completely abandoned it once European conquerors arrived. No more than 750 people  lived in Machu Picchu. Because of the specific area where it was built, the  city is surrounded by the most unique animals and plants, including butterflies  which do not live anywhere else in the world.   This small waterfall stands close to a mountain,  in an uninhabited area. The sky above them changes its blue color to green and  red when the night falls. Do you know where this phenomenon happens?Answer: Kirkjufellsfoss Waterfall, Iceland.  This stunning waterfall, which channels  the water from one of the many glaciers in Iceland, stands next to the  Kirkjufell Mountain (Church Mountain in Icelandic). This isolated mountain is  believed to be the most photographed place in Iceland, due to its remarkable  nature. The area around the waterfall is one of the few places in the world  where you can see aurora borealis,  better known as northern lights. These green, purple and red lights  occasionally start dancing across the dark winter sky, making the whole  landscape even more beautiful.  Imagine a place with golden fields where  you can smell fresh air and see low green hills everywhere around you. If you  knew this place was also known for its wines and art, could you guess what it  is?Answer: Tuscany, Italy.  Olive trees, sunflower fields, farms and  vineyards spread across Tuscany, a region in central Italy. What's perhaps even  more enchanting are its ancient castles, which look like they have been  untouched for centuries. The land in Tuscany is relatively low, with occasional  hills and mountains. The region got its name from the Etruscan people who  settled there around 3,000 years ago. There are over 120 protected nature  reserves, which proves how valuable this dream-like region is.\n",

      "  This long, curvy river is surrounded by green  hills and tall rocks. It is found in a place with many plant and animal species,  and known for its good weather. The country where this place is located is at  the same time the edge of a continent. Answer: Blyde River Canyon, South Africa.  The Blyde River formed this 16 mile (25  km)-long and 2,461 feet (750 meter)-deep wonder of nature, one of the largest  canyons in the world. In Dutch, blyde means \"happy, glad\", and this name was given to the river by Dutch explorers in  1844. The Blyde River Canyon is certainly one of the greenest places in the  world, due to the subtropical climate in the area. The wildlife in the canyon  is so diverse – there are monkeys and antelopes, as well as more some dangerous  animals like hippos and crocodiles.   There is a beautiful rock formation in the  shape of an arch surrounded by the sea. You can explore the area around it on a  boat, swim in the warm waters, or sunbathe on the beach. Where could this  perfect holiday destination be?Answer: Cathedral  Cove, Coromandel Peninsula, New Zealand.  One of the most visited tourist  attractions in New Zealand, the Coromandel Peninsula offers more than 250 miles  (400km) of white sand beaches. The best way to tour the peninsula is in a kayak  – you can go around the entire coast, or even descend down a waterfall. Even  though not many people live on the Coromandel nowadays, it is believed to be  one of the earliest Polynesian settlements. It is a popular retirement  destination – nearly a third of all residents on the peninsula are aged 65 or  over. Cathedral Cove, named after the large arch located there, is a marine  reserve, reachable only by boat or on foot.\n",

      "https://www.really-learn-english.com/english-reading-comprehension-interesting-festivals.html\n",
      "Festivals have been organized for thousands of years. A festival is an event celebrated by a particular community, or the entire country, and it is centered on some particular tradition. Most, but not all festivals serve to provide entertainment to the participants, so they tend to be complemented with music or dance. The majority of festivals are religious or based on folklore. One of the  oldest Indian festivals Holi is celebrated as a symbol of good over evil, the  arrival of spring and the end of winter. Also known as the Festival of Colors,  this event lasts for a night and a day, starting in the evening of a Full Moon  Day, normally in February or March. Holi celebrations begin with a performance  of religious rituals in front of a big bonfire, hoping that the prayers will  destroy the internal evil. In the morning, people smear each other with colors,  using powder, water guns and water-filled balloons. Holi has become so popular  that it is also celebrated in other Southeast Asian countries.The Carnival  in Rio de Janeiro is the biggest carnival in the world, dating back to 1723.  With more than 2 million people on the streets every single day, this carnival  parade offers a real spectacle. Held just before Lent starts, the festival  officially lasts from Friday night until Wednesday morning, but many Brazilians  continue celebrating for a few days more. A typical parade includes happy revelers,  colorful floats, as well as performances by samba schools – groups of local  people dancing. The most famous dance is, of course, samba, a traditional  Brazilian dance influenced by African traditions. Each year, the Queen of the  Carnival and up to two princesses are pronounced publicly.  Having  started in 1990, this is a relatively young festival, celebrated on the  fifteenth day of the first month of the lunar calendar, at the very end of the  Chinese New Year. Inspired by traditional folklore, this ceremony lasts whole  night, when thousands of sky lanterns light over the Pingxi District in Taiwan.  The lanterns are released to ward off the evil and let people know the town is  safe. The main lanterns are always over ten meters tall and they normally reflect  Chinese zodiac signs. Each of them has its own theme music, which makes the  whole performances even more magical. In addition to the main lanterns, there are  also hundreds of smaller ones, usually carried by children. These lanterns  portray images of historical figures or a specific theme.The  biggest tomato fight you will ever see happens every year on the last Wednesday  of August in Bunol near Valencia, Spain. Since 1945, La Tomatina participants  have traditionally been throwing tomatoes at each other purely for  entertainment purposes. History suggests that the event started by accident – by  youngsters attending the Gigantes y  Cabezudos festival with enormous figures with big heads. They grabbed some  tomatoes from a nearby stall and threw them at one of the giant figures who  accidentally fell down. The next year, these same young people came back with  their own tomatoes and started a tomato fight. Today, La Tomatina is so popular  that tomatoes are delivered in big trucks for thousands of people from all over  the world. \n",

      "Holidays are special days for the people of one nation or culture, which are set aside by the law or through a custom, and on which everyday activities, such as work or school, are normally suspended. Every country has several important holidays, which can be national – or important for the state, religious – important for a particular religious group, or simply cultural – such as celebrating the beginning of a season, for example. Thanksgiving is one of the most popular  and oldest holidays in the US, celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November.  It originated as a harvest festival, and was celebrated for the first time by  the Pilgrims in 1621. That particular feast lasted for three days, and was  attended by Native Americans as well. The holiday became known as the day of  thanking God for blessings such as a good harvest, plenty of food or a military  victory, but today it is more cultural than religious. Although it is debatable  whether the Pilgrims ate it at the time, turkey has become the most ubiquitous  food served on Thanksgiving. Other traditional foods are mashed potato,  cranberry sauce and pumpkin pie.Mexican people traditionally celebrate Christmas for twelve days – from Christmas evening on December 24th, to the Three Kings Day on January 6th (also called the Epiphany. Epiphany literally means a sudden moment of understanding).The Three Kings Day commemorates the end of these celebrations. This holiday was inspired by the biblical story of the three kings from the East (also referred to as three Wise Men or Magi), who spotted a bright star in the sky the night Jesus was born, and came to see baby Jesus.This holiday is so important for Mexicans that they often give additional gifts on this day, even though it is shortly after Christmas.Another custom specific for this holiday is baking the Rosca, a sweet bread ring in which a small baby Jesus figurine is placed. Whoever finds the figurine has to host another holiday's party in February.Chinese New Year is the biggest holiday in China, occurring on the last day of the last month of the Chinese calendar, which does not coincide with the December 31st, but instead falls between January 21st and February 20th.The celebrations are held all over the country and normally last for two weeks, making it the longest festival in China.During the celebrations, you can see incredible decorations such as dragons, lanterns, flowers, as well as fireworks and people dressed in traditional Chinese clothing. Windows and doors are usually decorated with red color papercuts to symbolize good fortune, wealth and longevity.This festival honors both Chinese deities (gods) and historical figures.  Although originally Irish, Saint Patrick's  Day is celebrated all over the world on March 17th. It has both a  cultural and a religious connotation, since it is named after Saint Patrick,  the greatest patron saint of Ireland who brought Christianity to the island,  and it is also a celebration of Irish culture and heritage. Since Irish people emigrated  to other European countries, as well as to the United States, Saint Patrick is  celebrated in more countries than any other national holiday. It is normally  manifested through a public parade, with many visitors wearing green attire,  since this color is the symbol of Ireland. Historically, any religious  restrictions on eating and drinking were lifted on this particular day, which  is why Saint Patrick's Day is heavily celebrated with lots of beer.This  holiday marks the beginning of spring in Japan. It is celebrated on February 3rd  as a part of the Spring Festival. The holiday is also known as the Bean  Throwing Day, because of the custom of throwing roasted soybeans out the door  while chanting 'In with Fortune! Out with Evil!'. It is believed that such a  ceremony prevents evil ogres (monsters) from entering the house, and that  instead only good fortune will come to the family. This is why during the  ceremony, one member of the family wears an ogre mask. Another peculiar  tradition done on this day suggests that if you want to enjoy a year of good  health, you should eat the same number of soybeans as your age. \n",

      "https://www.really-learn-english.com/english-reading-comprehension-islands.html\n",
      "Islands are pieces of land surrounded by water. Some are really small and uninhabited by people, whereas others were once homes to early civilizations, and are now independent cities or countries. Since many islands are not so industrialized, and have managed to preserve wildlife and nature, they offer a perfect escape from busy and noisy cities for millions of people.  French Polynesia is a French overseas territory in the  South Pacific Ocean. It includes around 120 islands. Its capital is located on the island of Tahiti. Bora Bora is situated approximately 140 miles (225km) northwest of Tahiti.A major tourist destination, Bora Bora is  a group of islands in the Pacific Ocean. These wonders of nature got their name  from the local Tahitian expression which means \"created by the gods\" (pora pora mai te pora). The main Bora  Bora island hosts remnants of an extinct volcano which is also the highest peak.  The true beauty of this island lies in the lagoon and the barrier reef which  surround it. A lagoon is an area of sea water that is separated from the ocean by rocks or sand.Many resorts are located on smaller islands around the lagoon.  Because of the amazing and diverse ocean life the lagoon shelters, snorkeling  and scuba diving are some of the most popular activities, where tourists can  also see sharks and rays (a ray is a sea fish with a largeflat body and a long tai)l.Indonesia a country consisting of a group of islands in South East Asia. Bali is the most popular island holiday destination in Indonesia.Unlike most other islands, Bali is a  crowded place, with its 4 million inhabitants and many thousands of tourists coming  in daily. It is also home to the most diverse coral reef population, with more  than 500 species found. Known as the Land of the Gods among the locals, Bali  hosts active volcanoes, rice fields and white sand beaches. It is visited by  many adventurers, as it is possible to surf and dive in the ocean, raft in  white river waters, go bungee-jumping on one of the cliffs, as well as mountain  climb.Fun fact: Bali is ruled by a unified confederation of  kingdoms. There are 10 traditional royal houses on Bali, each having control  over one area of the island.  This African country is in fact an  archipelago of 115 islands. Aarchipelago means a group of islands and the sea surrounding them.The main island, Victoria, is where tourists can  learn about the culture of the country, and visit the main Hindu temple and  Natural History Museum. Many Seychelles' beaches are untamed and not crowded at  all, which is why many  turtles feel safe there, so they come ashore to lay  their eggs. Nearly 90% of the country is covered in forest, so the islands are  a top destination for all lovers of wildlife and nature. You can observe some  of the 275 species of birds which live on the island, or simply enjoy  locally-grown exotic fruit.Fun fact: Due to their favorable location, the Seychelles  were used by pirates until the French took over the islands in 1756.  Greece has over 200 inhabited islands, yet  Santorini is one of the most popular ones, due to its unique white cubical  houses and churches with blue roofs. Located in the Aegean Sea, Santorini was  named after Saint Irene (a contraction of the name Santa Irini) during the Latin Empire. The current island is what  remained after a great volcanic eruption destroyed earlier settlements of the  Minoan civilization. This is why very high, steep cliffs are found on three  sides of the island. Besides amazing views and architecture, tourists are also  drawn to Santorini for its wines and traditional cuisine. Santorinio Sfougato, a vegetable dish served with local milk cheese  and herbs, is highly recommended.  One of the largest islands in the  Mediterranean Sea, Sardinia was also home to one of the earliest human  settlements in the region, named after Sardo, a legendary woman who was born in  the ancient Kingdom of Lydia (modern western Turkey). With nearly 2,000 km of coastline, Sardinia is  filled with spacious sand beaches such as Costa  Smeralda, having both remnants of ancient traditions and a vivid  nightlight. For those interested in history, the Nuragic complex includes  monuments dating from more than 3,500 years ago, spread across the island.  There are several popular festivals taking place in the capital Cagliari where  you can see traditional Sardinian clothes and hear music unique for the island,  produced by launeddas, a three-pipe  wooden instruments invented in Sardinia.\n",

      "See Israel, the Holy Land, Part 1Did you know that Israel has the highest ratio of museums per person in the entire world? This small country has so many important buildings and monuments, and dozens of wonderful natural places. Seeing all of them would take ages! Despite its name, the Dead Sea is a lake, one of the saltiest bodies of water in the world. Because it is has 10 times more salt than the ocean, the Dead Sea is a really harsh environment for any living organism – in fact, no plants or animals flourish in this lake, which is why it is called \"Dead\". The salinity and water density also make it impossible to swim in the lake. Instead, visitors can enjoy floating, and even reading while in the water.The lake holds another world record – being located 1,412 feet (430.5 meters) below sea level, which is the lowest place on land. The wonders of the Dead Sea have been known to humans for thousands of years. For a long time, essential minerals needed for fertilization of the land, and for health purposes have been supplied from the Dead Sea. The Hanging Gardens of Haifa, or the  Terraces of the Bahá'í Faith, is a complex of several garden terraces  surrounding the Shrine of the Báb in the city of Haifa. The terraces represent  the first eighteen followers of the Báb, the founder of Bábism, a small  religion started in 1844. Together with the terrace of the Shrine, the total number of terraces  is nineteen, a significant number for this religion. The terraces stretch for  0.6 miles (1 km) from the base of Mount Caramel to the summit, where the Shrine  of the Báb awaits. The Shrine is important because the Báb was buried there. No  religious services take place in the shrine. Visitors can come in for a quiet  prayer or meditation.Israel has access to the Mediterranean Sea  and the Red Sea. Eilat is the southernmost city in the country, and the only  port on the Red Sea. The coast is so short that it is possible to walk to  Jordan or Egypt in one day. Records show that Eilat was profitable for mining  even during the ancient Egyptian empire. On average, Eilat has 360 sunny days  in a year, which makes it a popular beach location all year round. The most  beloved attraction is the colorful coral reef, rich in marine life. Those who  are not adventurous enough to go diving can observe dolphins from a nearby  research station, or visit the Coral World Underwater Observatory, the largest  public aquarium in the region.At the foot of Mount Hermon lies the  source of the Banias River, protected in a nature reserve. The spring located  in this nature reserve was once associated with Pan, the Greek god of the wild.  There are still remnants of a shrine and an ancient city built by the Greeks.  In addition, the biggest waterfall in Israel is also located there. The nature  reserve is made up of two separate parks – the Banias Falls Park, with a trail  that leads directly to the waterfall, and the Banias Springs Park, where top  attractions include Pan's Cave and the Hermon stream. Visitors can visit the  nature reserve by hiking on one of the four trails, the longest one taking only  90 minutes.Located in northern Israel, Nazareth is  home to a mixed Muslim and Christian population. Historically, the city has  been best known as the place where Jesus Christ and his mother Mary lived.  Consequently, many sites important for Jesus' childhood and the early years of  his teaching are located in Nazareth and are seen as highly holy places. For  example, the Synagogue Church is believed to be the synagogue where Jesus was  taught as a child. Another very important building in Nazareth is the Church of  Annunciation. This large Catholic church was built on the site where an angel  called Gabriel announced to Mary that she was going to give birth to Jesus.  Visitors are also drawn to several Muslim places of worship, such as the White  Mosque, the oldest mosque in the city.See Israel, the Holy Land, Part 1\n",

      "For many thousands of years, people from different ancient civilizations, cultures and nations have come to Israel, a small country in the Middle East. Known as \"the Promised Land\" for the Jewish people, Israel is also home to people of other religions and a great number of buildings and sights important to them. Jaffa is the oldest part of the modern  city of Tel Aviv. An ancient myth suggests that this old port city got its name  after Yafet, one of the sons of Noah, who saved animals and humans from a large  flood. The place has been used as a strategically important harbor for  thousands of years. Walking around the Old Jaffa today, you will see all these  different layers of history. The Clock Square stands in the middle of Jaffa,  with its distinctive clock tower built in 1906. Another interesting sight is  the Andromeda rock, the rock where, according to mythology, Greek goddess  Andromeda was chained as a sacrifice before she was saved. Nearby, there is the  Al-Bahr Mosque, or the Sea Mosque, a small tower overlooking the harbor,  historically used by fishermen and sailors.Just outside Jerusalem's Old City lies the Mount of  Olives, named after the olive groves that used to cover its slopes. The  mountain is filled with sites that are important for several religious groups. It  has hosted a Jewish cemetery for at least 3,000 years. A couple of ancient monumental  tombs can be found in the Kidron Valley which lies beneath the mount. Christians  believe that this is also where Jesus Christ, the son of God, ascended to  heaven, which is why it is a major site of pilgrimage. The largest church that  rises on the mountain is the Church of Mary Magdalene, built by a Russian Tsar  (ruler) in 1886, noticeable for its gilded roofs.Also known as Kinneret, the Sea of Galilee  is the largest freshwater lake in Israel. The lake is actually located some 200  meters below sea level, which makes it the lowest freshwater lake in the world.  The Sea of Galilee was historically very important because it was on the Via Maris, an ancient route which  connected Egypt with the empires in the North. Nowadays, tourists are drawn to  this lake for two major reasons. Firstly, Jesus is believed to have taught and  performed many of his miracles in the areas around the lake, so Christians  frequently visit there. Secondly, Israelis and tourists come to the lake to take part  in different water activities, such as the building of rafts event, or the  Kinneret Crossing, a popular open water swim race. In Hebrew, rosh means \"head\" and hanikra means \"of the caves\", which explains what this amazing rock formation is all  about. White cliffs open into amazing caves in this area located on the coast  of the Mediterranean Sea. Being close to the Israeli border with Lebanon, for  centuries Rosh HaNikra was a passage point for traders and armies. While they  were building a railroad, the British dug a tunnel thanks to which, all sea  caves are now connected to each other. Years ago, only adventurous swimmers  could see this place, but today, visitors can get on the Rosh HaNikra cable  car, the steepest one in the world, to take them to the caves.For all those who cannot find enough time to  visit all tourist attractions in Israel, a possible solution could be to go to  Mini Israel, a miniature park where hundreds of replicas of famous sights in  Israel are located. Nearly all buildings are built to be 25 times smaller than  they are in real life. This means that an average church would be as tall as a  child, while a skyscraper might be a little bit taller than an adult. There is  a true variety of miniatures – from important religious and historical  buildings, to archaeological sites and some modern structures such as the  Supreme Court of Israel. Figures of people, animals, plants and vehicles are  also added to make the miniatures resemble to the originals even more.See Israel, the Holy Land, Part 2\n",

      "Istanbul, which used to be known  as Constantinople and Byzantium, is the most populous city in Turkey, and one  of the largest cities in the world, with the population of nearly 15 million  people. Built on the Bosphorus strait  (a narrow passage linking two seas), this magical city connects two continents.  It only takes several minutes to move from Europe to Asia by boat. It is a city  where more than two millennia of history awaits you. Hagia Sophia (meaning Holy Wisdom in Greek) was built in the 6  century, and until 1453 it served as a Greek Orthodox church. When Istanbul was  conquered by the Ottoman Empire, Hagia Sophia was converted into a mosque and  served as such until 1931. As Turkey became a secular republic, Hagia Sophia  stopped a religious purpose and was opened as a museum in 1935. For most of its  history, Hagia Sophia was the largest church in the world, and it is believed  to have completely changed the history of architecture with its massive dome.  The dome, in fact, inspired a lot of the Islamic architecture, which is why  today many mosques resemble to Hagia Sophia.  This large complex on the  Bosphorus is one of the most visited museums in Turkey. However, in the 15th  century, it was the main residence of the Ottoman sultans (emperors). The palace consisted of four main courtyards,  many smaller buildings and a harem, the  place where all the women of the palace lived. As the empire was expanding,  Topkapi Palace gradually lost its importance for the sultans. Today, only a few  of Topkapi's several hundreds of rooms and chambers are open for visitors.  When in Istanbul, make sure you  go to one of the bazaars (markets).  The most famous one, of course, is the big Spice Bazaar. Built in the 17th  century, this covered market is a perfect place to meet the locals and try  their products. In addition to a variety of colorful spices, you can also buy  jewelry, honey, nuts and dried fruits, all produced locally. Feel free to  bargain for some more expensive products.  Also known as the Blue Mosque due  to the colors of its walls and domes, this is one of the most magnificent  structures in the city. Although it is over a thousand years younger, the  Sultan Ahmed Mosque sits right next to Hagia Sophia. It is still a fully  functional mosque, which means that tourists also have to obey the religious  rules if they want to enter inside and see its amazing interior.\n",

      "Kiev, located on the Dnieper River, is Ukraine's capital city. With nearly 3 million inhabitants, Kiev is also one of the biggest and most vibrant cities in Eastern Europe. Home to hundreds of Orthodox Christian churches, international restaurants, spacious parks and the incredibly rich Ukrainian culture, Kiev will take your breath away. Also known as the Monastery  of the Caves, Pechersk Lavra is a historic Orthodox Christian monastery  which gave its name to one of the biggest districts in Kiev. This incredibly  beautiful complex started as a cave monastery nearly 1,000 years ago.  Interestingly, while being a major tourist attraction in Kiev, Pechersk Lavra  is also an active monastery, which means that over 100 monks live there. There  are several churches within the complex, while a part of the monastery serves  as a museum, where you can find many architectural relics of the past.Locally known as Maidan Nezalezhnosti, this square has  been in the center of many important events in the modern history of Ukraine.  The most recognizable monument on the square is the so-called Independence Monument, a 200ft tall victory  column placed in the center of the square. On the top of the column stands a  bronze figurine of a woman holding a rose branch. Since the beginning of the  Ukrainian independence movement, this square has been used for political  rallies and protests. Nowadays, the square hosts a number of cultural events,  and is a place where many city tours begin.  In the city of churches, the Golden Gate of Kiev strikes as a rather odd structure. Currently used as a museum, this was the main gate to the fortification of Kiev in the 11th century. The original structure was nearly completely dismantled, and only few vestiges remain. The rest was rebuilt in 1982 based on a speculation, since nobody knows how the original gate truly looked like. Today, the Golden Gate, made of brick and stone, stands a reminder of the antiquity of the city.With its  numerous parks and gardens, Kiev is perfect for picnics and outdoor activities. Hidropark is an island in the  Dnieper River whose natural beaches are very popular during the summer. Besides  swimming, you can also play beach volleyball, eat delicious street food or  simply sunbathe. Kiev is also home to one of Eastern Europe's most fascinating  zoos. Open both in winter and summer, the Kiev  Zoo has more than 2,600 animals from 328 different species, and many trees  and bushes which make it more exotic.\n",

      "There are 195 different countries in the world, and this number seems to be ever increasing. While some countries are in fact small towns with few residents, other countries are so large they can be homes to snow and sunny weather at the same time. Top six largest countries in the world account for nearly half of all the land in the world, so they never cease to inspire with their geography, as well as animal and plant diversity. When it comes to size, no other country in  the world comes close to Russia. With the total area of 6,612,100 square miles  (17,125,200 km2), Russia spans across the entire north of Asia, and it  also has a small part which geographically belongs to Europe. Russia is so  large it covers one-eighth of all inhabited land area on our planet. Although  the largest, this is only the ninth most populated country in the world with 144  million people, most of whom live in the European part. Spreading across eleven  different time zones, Russia's land is covered in steppes in the south, and  tundra in the north, which is called Siberia. The north coast of Russia is  usually covered in snow every single day of the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "  A steppes is a large,  flat area of land with grass but no trees. A steppes recieves little rain each year. This is enough rain to support  grasses, but not enough for  trees to grow. It is found in  temperate (without extreme cold or heat) regions of earth. \n",
      "\n",
      "  A tundra is a large, flat area of land with only low growing plants. It is found in very cold regions of earth. Tree growth is difficult there because of the cold temperatures,  and without much plants, few animal species can survive there.  The second largest country in the world, occupying  3,855,100 square miles (9,984,670 km2), is situated on the North  American continent and has only 36 million people. Like in Russia, some parts  of Canada are extremely cold, covered in snow all year round. The world's  northernmost settlement, only 508 miles away from the North Pole, is also  situated in Canada. Indigenous people like the Inuit, a group of Eskimos who  still build snow houses or igloos,  had lived in Canada for thousands of years before European settlers came.  Although Canada is a sovereign country, led by a Prime Minister and the  Parliament, British Queen Elizabeth II is officially still the ruling monarch.  Bordering only Canada and Mexico, the  United States of America (US) incorporate 3,796,742 square miles (9.833,520 km2)  of the Northern American continent. The US is a federation of 50 states,  famously depicted as stars on its flag. Forty  eight of these states are contiguous (sharing a common border), while Alaska, which was bought from  Russia in the 19th century, is in the northwestern corner of the  continent, across the entire Canada. The state of Hawaii is also detached from  other states, being an archipelago (a group of small islands) in the Pacific. Extreme weather conditions  are very likely in the south of the country. In fact, most of the world's  tornadoes happen in the US.  Despite having much smaller territory than  Russia, China is by far the most populated country in the world with 1.4 billion  of people. Spreading across 3,705,407 square miles (9,596,961 km2),  Chinese landscape varies greatly from one region to another, with grasslands,  steppes, forests and even deserts. Due to the fertile basin (an  area of land from which water flows into a river) of the Yellow  River, now located in the north of the country, China was able to rise as one  of the earliest and most powerful civilizations in the world. It is also one of  the few communist (non-democratic) countries in the world. Hosting nearly  35,000 different species of animals and plants, China is one of the most  biodiverse countries in the world, and home to the popular black and white  pandas.  Brazil, the largest country in South America,   has a population of 208 million and a territory of 3,287,956 square  miles (8,515,767 km2). Having once been a Portuguese colony, Brazil  today has very ethnically diverse population, with half of the residents  identifying as mixed race, and notable Asian and indigenous minorities. Since  the Amazon River basin is located in Brazil, the vast tropical forest around it  accounts for much of Brazil's territory. The Amazon rainforest is a protected  habitat (natural home of an animal or plant), unique not only for its rich wildlife, but also because some 70  isolated tribes still live in it. Due to heavy industrialization, this natural  heritage of Brazil is now threatened by mining, oil extraction and dam  building.The  only country on the Australian continent, Australia is composed of a massive  mainland, the island of Tasmania and several smaller islands, spreading across   2,969,907 square miles (7,692,024 km2). Australia was  completely unexplored by outsiders until the first Brits settled in the 18th  century. Prior to that, the country was solely inhabited by indigenous  Australians, called Aborigines. These groups, who ones spoke 250 different  languages, now make up only 2% of the total population. Australians normally live  in coastal areas, so the largest middle part of the country mostly has deserts,  grasslands, and very few people.

      "Lisbon, the capital  of Portugal, is built on seven hills at a place where the Tagus River meets the  Atlantic Ocean. It is a port city with a very rich history and a vibrant modern  culture. Some of the city's trademarks are its old squeaky trams, hilly narrow  streets in the districts of Alfama and Bairro Alto, and numerous elegant  squares.   Built in the 16 century, this  fortified tower played an important role during the Age of Discovery in  Portugal, having served as a part of the defense system. The tower sits on the  bank of the Tagus River, and it is considered to be one of the Seven Wonders of  Portugal.   Beige and white on the outside,  the structure consists of two parts: the bastion and the four-story tower on  the north side of the bastion. Tourists are welcome to visit the interior of  the tower, and to enjoy truly breathtaking views of the river from one of the  tower's terraces.  São Jorge Castle stands tall at  the top of a hill just above the historic center of Lisbon. It dates from  medieval times, and it was built as a fortification by the occupying Moorish  forces (the Moors were a group of North African Arab people) in the 10th  century. When it was renovated in the 14th century, the castle  counted as many as 77 towers. Over the years, it served as a royal palace, a  soldier's hospital and, occasionally, as a theater. São Jorge Castle was  severely damaged in the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, and has lost its strategic  importance since.  The castle complex offers an  impressive view of the historic part of the city. It is also very rich in  sightseeing-worthy places itself, as it consists of the castle, the ruins of  the royal palace, gardens, and a spacious square. The main square Praça d'Armas is beautifully decorated with  bronze cannons and statues, and definitely one of the most visited attractions  in Lisbon.  This 12.3 kilometers (7.6 miles)  long bridge is a relatively new structure in Lisbon, having opened for traffic  in 1998. It is the longest bridge in Europe, and is supported by additional 4.8  kilometers (3.0 miles) of access roads, which makes the overall experience of  seeing the bridge from afar even more amazing.   On average, the bridge serves  52,000 cars and trucks each day. In order to be able to withstand such traffic,  Lisbon's strong winds and unforeseeable weather conditions, the bridge was  built to survive an earthquake up to 4.5 times stronger than the 1755 Lisbon  earthquake.   Crossing this bridge is a great  way to realize how magnificent the Tagus River is, and move between northern  and southern regions surrounding Lisbon.  Bairro Alto is Lisbon's most  popular nightclub district. The streets of Bairro Alto are long, narrow and  colorful, shaped by three to four-story buildings and asymmetric facades. The  city of Lisbon has invested greatly in the remodeling of the district in recent  years, so many new bars, shops and traditional Portuguese restaurants were  open.   Bairro Alto is the youth  neighborhood of Lisbon. The district gives a great insight into Lisbon's  subcultures, and it is a perfect place to familiarize yourself with fado,  Portuguese traditional music. Cars are restricted in Bairro Alto, which makes  you feel isolated from city noises and traffic jams.  With very warm weather in the  summer, and mild winters, Lisbon is a popular tourist destination all year  round. Yet, as it often rains, it is advisable to always carry an umbrella or a  raincoat with you.  If you are in the mood for a  long, uphill walk, Bairro Alto can be reached on foot. Otherwise, you should go  with funiculars (a railway going up and  down a mountain), which promise some stunning views of the city. \n",

      "Famous for red double-decker buses and phone boxes, London, the capital of the United Kingdom (UK), is the most visited city in the world. With a population of around 18,000 people 1,000 years ago, London is now home to approximately 12 million people from all over the world. Getting to know all of the London's charms is a daunting task, but even a short visit will be an unforgettable experience for every tourist.   Queen Elizabeth II is probably the most famous reigning monarch in the world, having held the position for more than 55 years. The Queen and her family reside in the Buckingham Palace, which was built in the 19th century. The palace, now a focal point for the British people for both national celebrations and mourning, had Queen Victoria as its first resident. Located in Westminster, this grand palace has 775 rooms, and one of the largest private gardens in the world. Tourists are welcome to visit some state rooms, which are normally used for official meetings, in August and September.  Standing tall over the Thames River, Tower Bridge is one of the iconic symbols of London. While the bridge is freely accessible to both pedestrians and vehicles, there is an admission charge to enter its twin towers. Currently blue and white, the bridge had previously been painted red, white and blue for Queen Elizabeth II's Silver Jubilee, that is, the 25th anniversary of her accession to the throne. To allow large ships to pass, the bridge is raised around three times a day. During those times, all the traffic stops or is redirected to a different bridge.  British Museum's permanent collection, which counts as many as 8 million art pieces and artifacts, will overwhelm you. The collection originates from all continents, and it illustrates the story of human civilization, history and culture from the very beginning. This museum hosts more than 6 million tourists each year. This is where you can see Elgin Marbles, taken from the ancient Greek temple of Parthenon in Athens, and Rosetta Stone, one of oldest writings of Ancient Egyptian literature, carved on a stone. Like with all other public museums in London, the entrance to the British Museum is free.\n",

Learning about these customs gives us valuable insights into other cultures. \n",
      " In Morocco, wedding celebrations were  historically always held on Sundays, at the end of the harvest in the fall,  because that is where people in villages had most food to serve to their  guests. While in many Western cultures the bride wears a white dress, Moroccan  brides usually pick very colorful attire. For example, yellow is commonly worn  to scare away evil, while green is believed to bring good luck. Traditional  Moroccan wedding can last for up to seven days. The first three days are spent  on preparing the bride, including massages and milk baths.  The more traditional Chinese couples  consult a fortune-teller to decide on a favorable date for their wedding. Like  in many other cultures, on the wedding day, the groom comes to the bride's home  to negotiate the amount of money he will leave there in exchange for his bride.  Once the price is agreed on, the bride's parents and the groom sit down for a  cup of tea, served by the bride. At the wedding, the happy couple and their  guests sometimes perform the so-called lion  dance meant to scare away the evil spirits.  Many Italian couples get married on a  Sunday. An old folklore story suggests that no weddings or honeymoons should begin  on a Tuesday or Friday, otherwise the couple will have bad luck. The bride  wears a white dress and covers her face with a veil, to hide from any negative  influence. Sometimes, the groom also keeps a piece of iron in his pocket to  repel the evil spirits. After getting married in the church, the couple should  shatter a vase together. According to the popular belief, the number of broken  pieces represents the years they will spend together in happiness. During the  celebration, there is a particularly interesting ritual called buste, when the bride carries a bag  around so that the guests can put money in it.Mexican  brides dress differently in different regions, although simple white dresses  prevail. Sometimes, the bride sews three different ribbons – yellow, blue and  red - on the inside of the dress to symbolize food, money and passion. During  traditional ceremonies, the bride receives 13 gold coins from the groom. The  couple then exchanges their vows, after which the priest wraps a rope or a band  of flowers in the shape of the figure ''8'', which symbolizes the couple's  eternal unity. Usually, a mariachi (traditional Mexican music) band provides lively music for the wedding. As the couple enters the reception,  the band plays the traditional dance called La  Marcha.  \n",

      "Marriage is a recognized union between two people, called spouses, which establishes rights and obligations between them. Also known as matrimony or wedlock, this union can be recognized through social norms and laws or a ritual, and it also accepts the indisputable rights that any children born or adopted within that union have. People around the world have been performing marriage ceremonies for a long time, with each culture adding something special and unique. Celebrated with numerous rituals and ceremonies,  Indian weddings last for days. In Japan,  wedding ceremonies are traditionally held in Shinto shrines. Painted white from  head to toe, the bride also wears a white kimono (Japanese clothing). During the ceremony, the bride puts on a white hood to hide  her \"horns of jealousy\" that she feels towards her mother-in-law. She declares  herself a maiden, and promises to become a gentle and obedient wife. Throughout  the celebration, Japanese brides change their costumes several times, so they  also wear a red kimono, and a more modern dress. As a symbol of the newly established  union, the happy couple drinks sake,  a Japanese alcoholic drink made from  rice. In this tradition, known as san-san-kudo, the bride and groom each take three sips from three  different sake cups. Their parents do the same, which bonds their families  together.In Jamaica,  the entire community participates in nearly all stages of the wedding. More  precisely, everyone in the village comes together to help plan the wedding. On  the wedding day, everyone goes out in the street to see the bride and judge her  looks – if she is not perfectly dressed, they will criticize her. The wedding  celebration also involves a lot of traditional dancing, including Quadrille, a dance which originates from the  colonial times, when slaves secretly copied the dance moves from their masters.  Several cakes are served, and they are all brought in by married women wearing  white. One such cake is the traditional black cake, made from dark fruits and  rum.According to  Welsh wedding tradition, a man should carve a wooden spoon and give it to the  woman he loves. If she wears it, that means they are engaged. Another wedding  custom in Wales suggests that brides should be kidnapped by their families  shortly before their wedding day, so if the groom comes and rescues her, that  means they will be married. Welsh brides also put myrtles (a flower) in their bouquet, because it symbolizes love. The  bridesmaids receive a cutting of the myrtle and, if they plant it and see it  bloom, they will also marry soon.\n",

      "Although it doesn't have the size of a typical European city, Monaco has a lot to offer. This second smallest state in the world is famous for casinos and being incredibly multicultural. With merely 38,000 inhabitants, this city-state is in fact home to 125 different nationalities. Its land border is only 5.47 km (3.40 miles) long, and its coastline along the Mediterranean Sea is under 4km (2.4 miles). Yet, due to its history and wealth, Monaco offers a unique experience to every visitor.   It is commonly  believed that Monaco is a country and Monte Carlo its capital city, however,  this is not true. Monte Carlo is only one of Monaco's districts, but it surely is  the most famous one. In Monte Carlo, you can find numerous luxury hotels and  restaurants, as well as the country's only opera house. The Opera, known as Salle Garnier, is beautifully decorated  in red and gold, and it regularly hosts some of the most well-known  international performances, including ballet.  Furthermore,  this area is also where the Prince's  Palace is. This amazing palace originates from the 12th century,  and has been the residence of the Grimaldi family for centuries. The Palace is  open for the public, so many tourists decide to watch the catching of the guard  ceremony performed every day at 11.55 am. Another reason why Monte Carlo is  attractive for tourists is that Monaco's only public beach is located in this  neighborhood.  With several  thousand rare plants from all over the world, the Jardin Exotique (Exotic Garden)  is definitely worth visiting. Considering Monaco's high altitude, there is a  significant collection of subtropical and desert plants. Walking around the  garden, you will not only see large cacti and quite unique rock formations, but  you will also have a great view of Monaco's coast.  Not far from the  Jardin Exotique stands one of the most beautiful churches in Monaco, the Church  of the Sacred Heart. It was built in 1929 by Italian Jesuits as a sanctuary for  prayers. During the construction, the church's interior was embellished with  frescos painted by Italian painters. These frescos were recently renovated, so  their original bright colors are visible again.\n",

      "Desserts are everyone's favorite part of the meal. In most cultures, these delicious sweet dishes come at the very end of the main course, and can be served in all shapes and tastes – cakes, cookies, pies, even sweet soups, you name it! Despite millions of dessert recipes available in recipe books, there are some which have absolutely conquered the world with their unique tastes, causing pure happiness and bliss when eaten. But how did desserts come about in the first place? \n",
      "Modern cheesecake spread across the world as an  American product. It was developed in 1872 by accident when William Lawrence  was trying to recreate soft French cheese. Instead of cheese, he came up with heavier,  creamy base that is now part and parcel of the cheesecake. Yet, it is  speculated that ancient Greeks also made a form of cheesecake. Some say that  the athletes competing at the first Olympic Games in 776 B.C. ate cheesecakes  for energy. Greek physicians Aegimus even wrote an entire book on the art of  making cheesecakes in the 5th century. Nowadays, the bottom layer,  or the crust, normally consists of crushed cookies, and is covered with the  thickest cheesy layer, and topped with fruit.Also known as \"burnt cream\" or \"cream  catalana\", this dessert is unique for its rich custard base topped with a layer  of hard caramel. This is one of the oldest known desserts in Europe, having  appeared in Catalan cookbooks in the 14th century. Under the name of  crème brûlée, it first  showed up in a 1691 cookbook with recipes for royals and bourgeoisie (the rich).  Crème brûléeis always served in individual ceramic bowls. Nowadays, it is  popular to form the caramel directly on top of the custard. To complete this  task, a butane torch is used to burn the sugar, causing a small flame, which  makes the serving of the dessert very festive. The combination of filo pastry and chopped  nuts held together with syrup or honey is known all over the world as baklava.  Because baklava is the national dessert of several countries in Asia Minor and  the Middle East, its etymology is inconclusive, having links to Mongolian,  Persian and Turkish. The 15th century origin of the current form of baklava  is well-known – it was the Turkish sultan residing in Istanbul who sent baklava  trays to his young soldiers during the month of Ramadan (the 9th month of the Islamic year, when Muslims do not eat or drink between dawn and sunset). Before that, ancient  Romans ate a similar layered dough dessert they called placenta cake. Nowadays, baklava can be bought on the streets of  every major city in the region. It is sold per small piece, but buying more  than one serving is simply irresistible.Everyone in Southeast Asia has heard of  gulab jamun, a traditional Indian desert prepared since the medieval times. The  word gulab comes from Persian for  \"flower and water\", while jamun in an  Indian fruit which has a similar size and shape like this dessert. Gulab jamun  is created when milk solids are kneaded into a dough, shaped into small balls,  deep-fried and soaked in sugary syrup flavored with rose water. Being easy to  make, yet delicious, this dessert is eaten at all major celebrations such as  marriages and birthdays. Both Hindu and Muslim communities in India share the  love for this dessert, so they traditionally make it for their religious  holidays.\n",

      "https://www.really-learn-english.com/english-reading-comprehension-natural-wonders.html\n",
      "Throughout its long history, our planet  Earth has created many mountains, rivers, volcanos, forests and other beautiful  natural places. Some of them are considered to be really special due to their  beauty, incredible stories about their creation, and all the living organisms  which inhabit them. For these reasons, they are often referred to as the natural wonders of the world, deserving  admiration and respect from everyone. Imagine seeing the night sky turn bright  green, purple and red, and that all of these lights suddenly start dancing  around. It is one of most beautiful sights known to humans. Although these  lights, called auroras, look absolutely magical, their occurrence can actually  be explained through science. Appearing above the North and South poles, they  are created when electrically charged particles from the sun collide and  penetrate into the atmosphere. Their color variations depend on the type of gas  particles which come together. Auroras do not just appear every night – their  activity happens in cycles, and reaches its peak every 11 years. For this  reason, interested observers should really plan their trip carefully. Apart  from the poles, auroras are best seen in parts of Canada, Iceland, Norway and  the coastal waters of Siberia.  Located in the subrange of the Himalayas,  Mount Everest is the world's highest mountain, standing at 29,029 feet (8,848  meters). The Himalayas mountain chain was formed when the Indian tectonic  plate, or in other words massive rocks, pushed against the Asian plate. British  mountaineers tried to ascent to the summit of Mount Everest eight times before  two of them finally succeeded in 1953. Several thousands of people have climbed  to the peak since then, normally with the assistance of Sherpas, local Nepalese  people who carry the equipment and know the mountain very well. Because of the  harsh climate and the temperature that can drop down to -76°F (-60°C), this is a very dangerous journey. The  mountain is so high that the climbers have to use bottled oxygen to keep their  lungs functioning. Interestingly, the summit point also lies on the  international border between Tibet and Nepal.  This 227 mile (446 km) long canyon is  located in the state of Arizona and was carved by the Colorado River. The Grand  Canyon reaches the depth of over one mile (1,857 meters). It expands over a  vast area which was once inhabited by Native Americans, and was considered to  be a holy site. Scientists believe the Colorado River built this natural wonder  up to 6 million years ago. Even though the elevation change from the river to  the highest point in the canyon is huge, there are still quite a few plants and  animals living there, although most of the animals are rodents (mice and rats) and  bat species. Today, the Grand Canyon is a national park, and tourists can enjoy  climbing the beautiful red rocks, rafting on the river, or simply sightseeing.  Victoria Falls, or \"The Smoke that  Thunders\" (Mosi-oa-Tunya in the Tonga  language), as the locals call it, is a large waterfall on the Zambezi River,  bordering Zambia and Zimbabwe. The world famous explorer David Livingstone is thought  be the first European who found the waterfall, naming it in honor of Queen  Victoria. Victoria Falls is considered to be the world's largest waterfall  based on the amount of falling water – every second, some 33,000 cubic feet  (935 cubic meters) of water fall over. Still water levels are not constant, and  they particularly rise during the flood season from February to May. Victoria  Falls is surrounded by a rainforest where it actually rains every single day  due to all the vapor rising from the waterfall. Wildlife is abundant in this  forest, so it is common to spot an elephant, a zebra, or even a lion in the  areas around the waterfall.Consisting  of over 2,900 individual reefs and 900 islands, this is the largest coral reef  in the world, spreading across 133,000 square miles (344,400 km2).  Being larger than many countries, the Great Barrier Reef is visible from outer  space. The variety of living organisms which make the reef their home is  impressive. Over 1500 different species of fish, and a great number of turtles,  sharks and seahorses can regularly be seen in the reef. Thirty different  species of whales and dolphins also swim in these waters. While the climate  change greatly affects the biodiversity in the reef, most parts of it are  protected from fishing. Thousands of tourists who come in every day are also  asked to be careful about how they treat this precious environment. \n",

      "This city is often thought to be the center of the world. New York, the most populous city in the United States (US), is the capital of culture, finance, media and international diplomacy. Its five counties – Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, The Bronx and Staten Island are all famous in their own special ways. With nearly 9 million inhabitants, New York is also the most linguistically diverse city in the world where 800 different languages are spoken. Being a city that never sleeps, New York is a dream destination for many.   Although called a square, Times  Square is in fact an entire neighborhood in Manhattan, famous as a major  commercial intersection, entertainment center and a place with most flashing  billboards and advertisements. On certain days, more than 400,000 people walk  through Times Square, which makes it one of the world's busiest pedestrian  areas. This busy neighborhood, which got its name when The New York Times moved its headquarters there, attracts every  single tourist who comes to New York City. For this reason, it is called \"The  Crossroads of the World\".  Statue of Liberty is a colossal  copper statue located on the Liberty Island in New York Harbor. This statue, a  gift from the people of France, was built by Gustave Eiffel, who also  constructed the Eiffel Tower in Paris. The statue is a figure of a woman  representing Libertas (Latin for Liberty), a Roman  goddess representing the concept Liberty. She is holding a torch and a tablet (tabula  ansata) where the date of the U.S. Declaration of Independence is  inscribed. Libertas also has broken chains at her feet as a symbol of freedom.  During past migrations, the Statue served as a welcoming sight to many immigrants  arriving on ships.  This remarkable structure over  the East River is one of the oldest roadway bridges in the U.S. Connecting Manhattan  and Brooklyn, it is a favorite site for both tourists and locals, open for  pedestrians and traffic. Brooklyn Bridge is one the most easily recognizable  symbols of the city, having appeared in wide shots in many Hollywood movies.  The structure has also inspired many painters and playwrights.  Extremely tall buildings are such  a common thing in New York City that sometimes passengers on the street feel  like they can't see the sky. The Chrysler  Building, unique for its roof, is 319m (1,046 feet) tall, yet, it lost its  status as the tallest building in 1931. It was built during the New York City's  building boom, when different corporations were competing to build the world's  tallest building.   With 102 floors, the Empire State Building was the tallest in  the world for four decades. This breathtaking structure is one of the Seven  Wonders of the Modern World, and its name also serves as a nickname for the  city. At the moment, the tallest building in New York is the recently-opened One World Trade Center. This 541 m  (1,776 feet) tall architectural masterpiece was built in an effort to  memorialize the original World Trade Center destroyed in a terrorist attack.\n",

      "https://www.really-learn-english.com/english-reading-comprehension-oceania.html\n",
      "Oceania is a region in the Pacific Ocean,  consisted of about 25,000 islands, many of which are uninhabited. Oceania is  also defined as one of the seven continents, the smallest one in terms of land  area. The name Oceania is a translation of French Océanie, which derives from the Latin word oceanus and the Greek word okeanos, meaning \"ocean.\" The name was given to the  region by a geographer called Conrad Malte-Brun because, unlike with other  continents connected by land, it is the ocean that links different nations  together into Oceania. The continent is further divided into four  sub-regions: Micronesia, Melanesia, Polynesia, and Australasia.(Click on the map to see a larger version.) The name \"Micronesia\" derives from Greek mikros, meaning \"small\" and nesos, meaning \"island.\" Such a name is  perfect for this west Pacific sub-region of Oceania which is comprised of over  2,100 small islands. Some of the islands of Micronesia were first settled  several thousand years ago when people migrated from South Asia. The first  European to reach one of the islands, called Marianas, was the great Portuguese  explorer Ferdinand Magellan (in 1521 AD). The largest island in Micronesia is Guam, a territory  of the United States. The United States captured the island in the  Spanish-American War in 1898.Another Micronesian island is Nauru, the second  least-populated country in the world after Vatican City in Italy, with only around  11,000 residents. This small island country is surrounded by an amazing coral  reef, which is home to a rich ocean life.Melanesia is a sub-region which lies south  from Micronesia, occupying the southwestern area of the Pacific. Its name comes  from Greek melas which means \"black\"  and nesos, meaning \"island.\" The  expression \"island of black (people),\" referring to the dark skin of the native  people, was first used in 1832 by Jules Dumont d'Urville, a French explorer.  There are four independent countries in Melanesia: Vanuatu, the Solomon  Islands, Fiji, and Papua New Guinea. The population living in these countries  is very diverse. For example, there are 1319 known languages spoken in  Melanesia! Most of these languages are spoken in Papua New Guinea. This country  is one of the most rural areas in the world, with only one-fifth of its 8  million people living in cities. Being one of the earliest inhabited places by  humans, Papua New Guinea still has parts which are completely unexplored. This means  there are plants, animals, and even people, which still remain undiscovered.The name Polynesia (in Greek polys means \"many\" and nesos means \"island\") was first used in  1756 by Charles de Brosses, a French writer, to describe this sub-region of  thousands of islands scattered around the central and southern areas of the  Pacific. This sub-region includes several independent nations as well as  overseas territories like French Polynesia (a French overseas territory comprising of about 120 islands, one of which is  Tahiti). While the people of Polynesia share  some traits, they are divided into two different cultural groups: East and West  Polynesia. The West Polynesians, including the people of Tuvalu (an island country  north of Fiji) and Samoa (an island group  east-northeast of Fiji), have  had well-developed institutions for a long time. The East Polynesian cultural group  is comprised of smaller islands such as Rapa Nui (an island of Chile). Rapa Nui is also known as  Easter Island (because it was encountered by Dutch explorers on Easter Day). It is famous for its 887 enormous statues of human figures, built by  the native people between 1250 and 1500.Australasia is a sub-region which  includes Australia, New Zealand and several neighboring islands in the south  Pacific. The French writer Charles de Brosses also coined this terms, which  derives from the Latin australis,  meaning \"southern,\" to describe a place \"southern from Asia.\" In the early 20th  century, this name was used for the combined Australia and New Zealand sports  team, when these two countries competed together at the Olympic Games in 1908  and 1912. Australia has the largest land area and population in Oceania. Most  of the animals in Australia, such as kangaroos and koalas, are found nowhere  else in the world because they have been isolated by the ocean for millions of  years. The large island of New Zealand, which lies some 930 miles (1,500 km)  southeast of Australia, is known for its sheep industry. There are about 11  sheep for every person in New Zealand, meaning  44 million of them!\n",

      "https://www.really-learn-english.com/english-reading-comprehension-oldest-cities.html\n",
      "As agriculture developed, people produced surplus food, and trade became an everyday activity. Most historians believe these trends in agriculture are responsible for the birth of cities. Yet, some think cities were first built for defense reasons. In either case, there are several cities in the world which have continuously been inhabited for thousands of years. \n",
      "Through its ancient archaeological sites,  Jericho tells countless stories about the history of humans. Not only is this  the city with the oldest wall, built around the first community 10,000 years  ago, but it is also mentioned in the Hebrew Bible as the \"City of Palm Trees\". Jericho's  Arabic name Ariha means \"fragrant\". In  the beginning, the indigenous populations lived alone in an agricultural  community, but slowly, different groups of nomads joined them. This city has  had a turbulent history ever since, yet it remained continuously inhabited. Nowadays,  several Christian pilgrimage sites located in the city make Jericho a popular  tourist destination.   People have been living in Byblos for more  than 8,000 years. An ancient myth suggests that this city, lying on the coast  of the Mediterranean Sea, was built by Greek god Cronus. The earliest records  show that the city was in fact called Gubal.  The Greek name Byblos was most probably adopted because papyrus (paper), which  was imported through this city, was also called byblos in Greek. (That is why biblion in Greek means \"book\", and it is also the origin of the English word bible.)Byblos was a small fishing village at first, but  as trade increased, it became an important shipping port. Although destroyed numerous  times, Byblos still has remnants of its ancient history, particularly its  temples, to offer to curious tourists, many of whom also find it to be a great  beach destination.  Luxor's name derives from the word al-uqsur, which in Arabic means \"fortifications\".  Indeed, Luxor is so rich in temples, monuments and ruins of ancient buildings,  some of them dating back to 3000-2000 BC. For this, this city on the Nile River  is described as the greatest open-air museum in the world. Before it was named  Luxor, this city was the site of Thebes,  the ancient capital of Egypt. During the New Kingdom period in Egypt's history,  most rulers decided to be buried in the Valley of Kings, near Luxor. This is  where the extremely well-preserved tomb of King Tutankhamun was discovered in  1922. The second largest ancient religious site in the world, Karnak, was built  during this period and is now a major tourist attraction in Luxor.  The capital of Greece has been inhabited  for more than 7,000 years. An ancient myth suggests two Greek gods Poseidon,  god of the sea, and Athena, goddess of wisdom, fought about who would become  the protector of a new city. While Poseidon offered a sea water spring to the  people, Athena gave them an olive tree, so the people chose to name the city  after her. The hill of Acropolis, where the world-famous temple of Parthenon is  still located, was where the Mycenaeans, a small community that originally  inhabited Athens, built their fortress. During its long history, Athens  witnessed the peak of the ancient Greek civilization, having been home to some  of the greatest thinkers and writers who forever changed the course of history. The  Old City of Jerusalem, a fortified area located in the center of the modern-day  Jerusalem, is one of the oldest continuous human settlements in the world. The  recorded history suggests that in the 11th century BC, King David  took over Jerusalem and made it the capital of his kingdom. There had been small  communities living on the site prior to King David's arrival. Under Solomon,  King David's son, the city walls expanded and the place became highly prosperous.  Throughout  history, the city had been repeatedly conquered by, among  others, Alexander the Great, the Romans and the Muslim armies, all of whom  built important religious structures in the city. Due to these incredible  events, today the Old Jerusalem is the place where people of different  religions come together to pay their respects to their holy sites.\n",

      "Big cities show the heart of a country. When people think of France, they often see Paris in their minds. Paris is a symbol of the delicious food and high fashion that is the heart of France. In the same way, Phnom Penh is the heart of Cambodia. Phnom Penh is a symbol of the triumphs and the tragedy of Cambodian history. This important city also shows the growing self-confidence of the Cambodian people as they showcase their culture, historical monuments, and Buddhist heritage for world visitors.  Cambodia is a country in Southeast Asia. Cambodia borders Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam. The Cambodian coastline runs along the Gulf of Thailand. The major language of Cambodia is Khmer. Its major religion is Buddhism. Cambodia was ruled by France, but it became a free nation in 1953. In the 1970s the country went through a violent period under the Khmer Rouge, a communist political group. Now Cambodia is at peace and working to make life better for its people. Phnom Penh sits in the southern half of Cambodia at the intersection of three rivers. It is the biggest city in the country with more than one million people. It is also the capital of Cambodia. Many important cultural, religious, and historical sites are here. One historical site that is popular with locals and tourists is Independence Monument.  This monument commemorates the time that Cambodia became independent from France. It also honors the people who died in the war for independence. The Cambodian Architect Vann Molyvann built the monument as a lotus flower. The reddish brown monument stands about 20 meters tall. At night, blue, red, and white lights shine on the monument. Blue, red, and white are the colors of the Cambodian flag. The people hold festivals around the monument to celebrate holidays such as Independence Day and Constitution Day. The Royal Palace is a political and religious attraction in Phnom Penh. The Royal Palace is the home of the King of Cambodia. Tourists can find the sacred Emerald Buddha here as well. The Emerald Buddha is a seventeenth century statue made of beautiful green crystal. Royal ceremonies take place at the Palace. Gifts from other countries line its walls. The Palace also has a 600 meter mural (a picture  painted on one of its walls). The mural shows a popular religious story. The Center of Cambodian Buddhism is another attraction in Phnom Penh called Wat Ounlom. This ancient shrine, built in 1443, holds the eyebrow hair of Lord Buddha. At one time 500 monks lived at the shrine. The Khmer Rouge killed many monks and tried to destroy the shrine, but they did not succeed. The eyebrow hair was saved, and the shrine continues to be an important religious symbol. The Museum of Genocide tells about the suffering caused by the Khmer Rouge communist party. The museum used to be a high school. The Khmer Rouge made the high school into a prison in the 1970s. Those who were against the Khmer Rouge were tortured and killed here.  Visitors can see how prisoners lived and hear stories from survivors of the prison. Tourists can enjoy street food made by locals or choose one of the gourmet restaurants in the city center. Locals and tourists love fish amok, a true example of Khmer street food. Fish amok is a dish that mixes spices with fish and coconut curry. It is a favorite snack food. Phnom Penh has many fancy restaurants too. Romdeng is a gourmet restaurant that has a social mission as well. The restaurant serves authentic Cambodian foods and trains poor Cambodian children in the art of food service. Visitors who want excitement can take a Tuk-Tuk taxi tour. A Tuk-Tuk taxi has three wheels. It is perfect for zipping around the popular tourist sites of the city. The drivers are expert guides and give a personal and fun experience of the city. A more relaxing way to see the country is a cruise on the Mekong River. Away from the energy of the city center, you can hear and see the slower pace of life along the banks of the river.  Farmers work in their rice fields and raise fish in their fish farms. Local silk weavers show their crafts. The natural beauty of the river is all around you.\n",
      "44-Planets of Our Solar System\n",
      "https://www.really-learn-english.com/english-reading-comprehension-planets-of-our-solar-system.html\n",
      "The planet we live on is called Earth.  Earth goes around a star called the Sun, and as such classifies as a planet. The Sun and everything that  circles it form together a system called the  solar system (solar = of the sun). In our solar system, there are additional seven planets, and dwarf planets (planetary objects which  do not qualify as planets). Each of these planets takes a  different amount of time to travel around the Sun. For the Earth, this journey  is 365.25 days long, but for a faraway planet like Neptune, it takes 165 years.  There are smaller objects which do not circle the Sun, but around these  planets. They are called satellites,  or moons, just like Earth's only natural satellite.  The planet closest to the Sun is named  after Mercurius, a Roman god. Being a messenger god, Mercurius moves around  quickly, so his name was a good fit for this planet because it travels the  shortest amount of time around the Sun. Because it is so close to the Sun,  Mercury is a really hot planet. During the day, the temperature can go up to  840 °F (450 °C). However, at night, the planet cools  down quickly, and the temperature drops to – 290 °F (-180°C). Mercury has a  huge iron core, and a very thin atmosphere (a mixture of gases around a planet).  It can sometimes be seen from Earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Venus is the Roman goddess of love. The  second planet in our solar system was considered to be the brightest object in  the sky and one of the most beautiful sights, and this is why this goddess was  chosen for its name. This is a rocky planet with very thick clouds which  prevent us from seeing its surface. Certain radars have detected multiple  volcanoes on Venus. One such volcano is Maat Mons. This 5.6 mile (9km)-tall  volcano is constantly surrounded by lava, hot liquid rock, due to its regular  activity. Venus can sometimes be even warmer than Mercury.  Our planet Earth is the only planet which  was not named after a god or a goddess. In Latin, our planet is known as Terra,  meaning \"the ground\". Terra is also the name of the Roman goddess of the earth.  Gaia, deriving from the Greek Ge,  meaning \"land\", is the Greek goddess of the earth. Instead of Terra or Gaia,  the modern term \"Earth\" was preferred. It developed from an Old English noun eorðe, which also means \"the ground\". Unlike all other planets in our solar system, Earth is the only one which has  the right conditions for life. There are oxygen and water, and the temperature  is warm enough, thanks to which millions of species live on our planet.  Mars is known as the Red Planet. What  makes it so bright red is rust, a reddish-brown substance that forms on iron,  is in its soil. However, when it came to naming the planet, people associated  the red color with blood and war, which is why borrowed its name from the Roman  god of war. Water on Mars has been frozen into rocks, so there is a suspicion  there could be primitive life forms on this planet. We also know that strong  winds, which cover the entire planet in dust, frequently occur on Mars.  Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar  system. It is 11 times wider than Earth. For this reason, both the Greeks and  the Romans named it after their supreme gods. In Greek, this planet was known  as Zeus, while the Romans called it Jupiter. This planet has many moons. Four  largest ones were discovered by Galileo Galilei, an Italian astronomer, in  1610. The smallest of them, called Europa, is covered in ice, so scientists  believe this satellite may support some life forms.   In Roman mythology, Saturn is a version of  the Greek God Cronos, Zeus' father and god of agriculture. This planet has a  large number of satellites (53 of them). Most of them were named after Titans,  brothers and sisters of Saturn in Greek mythology. The largest moon, called Titan is even bigger  than Mercury. This planet is recognizable by its system of seven shining rings  which circle the equator, the line which is half-distance between two poles.  They look solid, but in fact they are scattered pieces of rock and ice.   The sixth planet, Uranus, was discovered  in 1781 by a British astronomer Willian Herschel. Upon this event, Uranus  became the first planet to be discovered with a telescope, a device which makes  faraway objects look closer and larger. Herschel wanted to name the planet  after King George III, who was then the ruling monarch of the British Empire.  Nevertheless, in the same year, the planet was named Uranus, after the Greek  god of the sky, and the father of Saturn. Uranus has 27 moons.  Johann Gale, a German astronomer, was the  first to observe the eighth planet in 1846. The international astronomical community  decided to give this planet a Roman name after the god of the sea. At that  time, it was believed that Neptune was the furthest planet in the solar system,  watching over the \"sea\" that we called the space. Out of all the planets in our  solar system, Neptune has the most powerful hurricanes. Its winds blow at  speeds up to 750 miles (1200 km) per hour. Due to the presence of methane gas,  this planet appears to be deep blue.Pluto  is the god of the underworld, living in a dark and cold place. Being so far  away from the Sun, this dwarf planet is supposed to be very dark as well.  Temperatures are as low as -369 F (-223 C), and it takes Pluto 247.7 years to travel  around the Sun. Pluto was the last planet to be discovered. In 1930, it was  spotted by a US astronomer Clyde Tombaugh. In recent years, there has been a  disagreement about Pluto's status, which is why it was declassified. Because it  is small and different from other planets, it is considered to be one of the  five \"dwarf\" planets, but not everyone supports this opinion.\n",

      "  The second  largest and most famous Brazilian city, Rio de Janeiro (nickname: Rio) is known  for its annual carnival, relaxed beach culture and stunning landscape. Rio  charms everyone at first glance – its harbor is surrounded by three green  mountains, a lagoon and more than ten beaches. Local people call it \"the  marvelous city\", which truly is the best way to describe this pearl of the South  American continent.   Corcovado  (meaning \"hunchback\" in Portuguese) is one of the mountains surrounding the Guanabara  Bay. The mountain is covered in the Tijuca  Forest, which is also a national park, and it is possible to climb to its peak,  which stands at 2,329 feet (710 meters). The peak is also accessible by train,  and it offers a breathtaking panoramic view of the entire city and its  surroundings. What Corcovado is most famous for, however, is the giant 125  ft-tall statue of Jesus Christ, called Christ  the Redeemer, which stands atop its peak. Overseeing the city, this statue  has become the symbol of Rio.  Many tourists  visit Rio on their beach holiday. There are both in-bay and oceanic beaches. Both  oceanic, Copacabana and Ipanema are definitely the most popular  beaches in Rio, with many songs sang about their beauty. While it would be hard  to surf in the Guanabara bay, since the waves are very clam, these two beaches  are perfect places to practice the local way of riding the waves - pegar  jacaré (grabbing an alligator),  which involves swimming on top of a big wave. The beaches of Rio are also where  tourists can try cheap local food and drinks – a classic cooling beverage is mate  com limão, ice tea with lemonade, while empadas are baked pastries  with meat or cheese.  Located in the  South Zone of the city, this beautiful lagoon connects the Atlantic Ocean and  the Jardim de Alah Park through a  canal, allowing sea water to be a part of the park. There are two islands on  the lagoon, mostly used for water sports. nown as \"The Heart of Rio de  Janeiro\", the lagoon is where locals like to gather to row or bike. The Lagoon  is particularly popular during the holiday season – which for Brazilians is  summertime – because of a giant Christmas tree which floats around the lagoon  on a platform. \n",

      "Rome, the capital of Italy, is a city like no other. For more than two millennia, this city has been the center of European culture, politics and religion. Walking around the streets of Rome feels like taking a tour through the history of humankind. Rome is densely populated with ancient churches, Roman ruins, beautiful fountains, spacious squares (piazzas) and expensive shops. In simple words, it is a city for everyone.    Also known as the Flavian  Amphitheater, the Colosseum is the largest amphitheater ever built.  Construction of this grand structure was completed in AD 80 during Emperor  Titus' rule. Colosseum famously hosted gladiatorial contests, where armed men  fought other men or animals. Besides entertainment, the amphitheater had many  different purposes throughout history. More precisely, it was used as a  fortress, a Christian shrine, and for housing. Today, it is one of the most  popular attractions and a place of importance for the Catholic Church.   The Vatican is a city-state  within Rome. Despite being the smallest country in the world with only 1,000  people, it is filled with historical artifacts and artwork. This breathtaking  place is also home to the Pope, the Catholic Church's head. Interestingly, it  is the only place in the world where Latin is spoken as the official language.  Some of the most visited tourist attractions in the Vatican City include St.  Peter's Basilica and the Vatican Museum.  This enormous basilica took more  than 100 years to build. It was originally designed by Bramante and  Michelangelo, and it still hosts Michelangelo's famous sculpture Pieta. Considering that the basilica is  of central value to the Catholic world, a lot of tourists visit it every day. However,  it is still possible to enter even during Mass (a religious ceremony), except  on Wednesday mornings when access to the basilica is limited to papal  audiences.  The famous and most beautifully  decorated Sistine Chapel is located in the Vatican Museum. The walls of the  chapel are divided into three levels. The middle level contains paintings by  artists like Botticelli. The upper level and the ceiling were painted by the  legendary Michelangelo, who worked on these art pieces for four years. In the chapel,  you can also visit the papal apartments painted by Raphael, another great  master of Italian art.Built in the 18 century, the Trevi Fountain is  one of the most famous fountains in the world. It was placed at the junction of  three roads (tre vie). Most tourists  try not to miss this place because of the coin throwing tradition according to  which throwing a coin into the fountain using your right hand over your left  shoulder brings good luck. Every day, more than 3,000 Euros end up in the Trevi  Fountain. \n",
      "47-Saint Petersburg\n",
      "https://www.really-learn-english.com/english-reading-comprehension-saint-petersburg.html\n",
      "Saint Petersburg is Russia's pearl on the Baltic Sea. This magnificent city lies on the Neva River in continental Europe. It carries layers of Russian and European history, having been at the frontline of many important wars and battles in the past several centuries. The name Saint Petersburg refers to Saint Peter, one of the early teachers of Christianity, and Peter the Great, a former ruler of Russia. When World War I started in 1914, the city was renamed Petrograd (meaning \"Peter's City\"). Five days after Vladimir Lenin, the first non-imperial leader of Russia died in 1924, the city was called Leningrad (meaning \"Lenin's City). In 1991, when the Soviet Union collapsed, the city again adopted its old name Saint Petersburg. \n",
      "One of the largest and most visited  museums in the world, the Hermitage, is housed in the palace the Russian royal  family used as their winter residence. It was established in 1764 by Catherine  the Great, a Russian Empress who owned an extraordinarily large collection of  paintings. At the moment, there are more than three million items which belong  to the Hermitage; however, only a small part of them is on permanent display. Visitors  can enjoy a wide range of artifacts from all periods of history, from Egyptian  antiquities and prehistoric art to famous paintings by 19th-century  artists such as Van Gogh and Degas. This large complex consists of six  buildings, five of which are open to the public. This is very different from  how things were in the past. The museum was initially very exclusive which  means only very few people were allowed to visit it. This is why the museum was  given the name Hermitage which derives from Old French hermit, meaning \"a person who lives alone.\"\n",
      "  Orthodox Christianity presents an  important part of Russian identity, so there is a high number of churches all  over Saint Petersburg. The most visited is the Kazan Cathedral, dedicated to Our  Lady of Kazan, a very holy icon for the Russian Orthodox Church. The  construction of this church was completed in 1811. It was modeled on Saint  Peter's Basilica in Rome, the largest cathedral in the world. The interior of  the church is decorated with many icons and sculptures made by famous Russian  artists. The cathedral is also admired for its huge bronze doors which are a  copy of the doors found in the Baptistery, an 11th-century church in  Florence, Italy. The history of this cathedral is fascinating because the  building did not serve for religious purposes for 60 years. Under the communist  rule, the church was closed down in 1932 and reopened as the Museum of the  History of Religion and Atheism. The service only resumed in 1992, and since  then the Kazan Cathedral has become the main cathedral in Saint Petersburg.   One of the earliest buildings in Saint  Petersburg is the Saint Alexander Nevsky Monastery. Founded in 1710 by Peter  the Great, this monastery was built on the site of the Neva Battle which took  place in 1240. In this battle, a famous warrior and Prince Alexander Nevsky  defeated Swedish forces. The complex contains three churches of different architectural  styles built in different periods in the 18th century. By the  monastery, you can also find the Tikhvin Cemetery. This place is famous because  many figures important for Russian history and culture, such as the author Fyodor  Dostoevsky and the composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, were buried there. At the  Alexander Nevsky Square right by the monastery, visitors can buy bread which  the monks living in the monastery bake to support themselves.  Peter and Paul Fortress was the first  structure built in Peter the Great's new town of Saint Petersburg. Located on  the Hare Island on the north bank of the Neva River, this fortress had the  purpose of protecting the city from any potential attacks by the Swedish forces.  However, the fortress did not serve for military purposes at all, but it was  instead turned into a prison for political prisoners used by different  governments. Under the Imperial rule, those who were suspected revolutionaries  were put in the fortress. After the Russian Revolution, hundreds of Emperor's  officials were kept imprisoned. Today, visitors can see the Peter and Paul  Cathedral which is where nearly all Russian tsars were buried. The fortress is  also the site of several sandy beaches where the residents of Saint Petersburg  like to relax in the summer.\n",

      "https://www.really-learn-english.com/english-reading-comprehension-sarajevo.html\n",
      "The capital of Bosnia and  Herzegovina, Sarajevo, is one of the historically most interesting cities in  Europe. It is the only major city on the continent to have a mosque, a Catholic  church, an Orthodox church and a synagogue all in the same quarter. Due to this  incredible diversity, Sarajevo is often called \"Jerusalem of Europe\" or of the  Balkan peninsula, where it is located. Apart from Istanbul, Sarajevo is the  only Muslim capital in Europe. That said, walking around the historic district  of Sarajevo, called Bascarsija, and hearing the call for prayer from a nearby  mosque is often a unique experience for tourists. In Bascarsija, you can visit  the old bazaar (market) and shop for woodwork, sweets or jewelry. The most  iconic monument is a wooden fountain called Sebilj. Built in the 18th century, Sebilj still offers  drinkable water to travelers. It is also the place surrounded by so many pigeons  that the area itself is called Pigeon  Square. There are many sellers offering corn to those who would like to feed  the birds.The Sacred Heart Cathedral is the  largest Christian cathedral in Bosnia and Herzegovina, built in the 19th  century. It was modeled after the Notre-Dame of Dijon, a cathedral in France.  As Yugoslavia began to fall apart in 1991, the cathedral became the scene of  peace demonstrations. When it comes to the stunning interior of the cathedral,  the main altar (a type of table used in Christian churches) was made of Italian  marble, while the windows were brought from Vienna. The church also offers a  mass (religious ceremony) in English every Saturday.At the very entrance to the central walking  area of the city, you can find the Eternal Flame, a memorial to the victims of  World War II in Sarajevo. This memorial was revealed in 1946, a year after the  city was liberated. It consists of an open Flame that never burns down and an  inscription dedicated to the victims, decorated in the colors of the flag of  Yugoslavia. This monument is valuable to many people who are nostalgic about  the old times when Yugoslavia was one country.\n",
      "The most popular day-trip  destination for those staying in the city center is Vrelo Bosne, a public park  on the outskirts of Sarajevo where the River Bosna's spring is located. In this  park, you can also find a Roman bridge which was built in the 16th century  from the original Roman ruins. Being hidden from the busy streets of Sarajevo,  the park can be entered on foot or by horse carriage. Traveling in a carriage  is a unique experience because the horses will take you down the long main  avenue, along which you can see older and more traditional buildings and peek  into Sarajevo's Austro-Hungarian past.\n",

      "https://www.really-learn-english.com/english-reading-comprehension-shanghai.html\n",
      "In this city there is a river walk lined with buildings in the French, Russian, and English styles of architecture. There are banks and financial offices from all over the world. There is a world famous garden and futuristic skyscrapers. The name of this city may surprise you. All these features are in Shanghai, the largest and most international city in China.  The full name of China is The People's Republic of China. China sits in East Asia with the Pacific Ocean along its eastern coast. It is the third largest country in the world with an area of 9.6 million square kilometers, about the size of Europe. China has the largest population of any country. Almost 1.4 billion people live in China. The capital of China is Beijing. The official language of China is Mandarin. Although China has one of the oldest cultures in the world, the economy of China has kept pace with modern times. China is now the second most important economy in the world.  Shangai sits on the east coast of China on the Huangpu River. This river divides the city into two parts. While Shanghai began as a fishing town, it has grown into the richest city in China and a global financial center. People from many countries and cultures live in Shanghai. The city is known as \"China's Gateway to the West\" because of its international population.   One of its most famous tourist sites is the Bund, a walkway along the Huangpu River. From the Bund you can see buildings from China's colonial history as well as China's modern skyline. In the mid-1800s China opened Shanghai to people from other countries. Russians, Americans, and Europeans built banks and homes along the Huangpu River in the style of their home countries. Tourists can walk along the Bund and see these western style buildings today. Two of the most famous buildings along the Bund, the Peace Tower and The Bank of China, are lit by lavender lights as the sun sets.  Across the river from the older buildings of the Bund rise unique skyscrapers which form the modern skyline of Shanghai. Here tourists can see The Oriental Pearl TV and Radio Tower. This building is a working TV and radio tower, but the fun design and things to do inside the tower make it a popular tourist site. The huge tower rests on a tripod. As the tower goes up, it spreads out into three large spheres. The spheres look like balls on a stick. Visitors can go up to the top of the tower in an elevator. Then they can go back down and do other activities like visit a museum or explore a model of a futuristic city inside the spheres.  Tourists can visit another world class skyscraper, the Shanghai World Financial Center. This building is the second tallest skyscraper in China. The main purpose of this building is to provide offices and meeting rooms for the international banking community. However, tourists are welcome. An elevator takes visitors to the top. People can see spectacular views of the Bund and the Huangpu River. Brave tourists can go on the Skywalk, a hallway with a glass floor and glass walls. On the Skywalk visitors feel like they are walking through the clouds!  For a look at classical Chinese buildings and gardens, visitors go to the Yuyuan Garden. The garden was built during the Ming Dynasty over 400 years ago. A government official wanted to give his parents a quiet, beautiful garden to enjoy. Today visitors can walk along garden paths and see old trees and flowering plants guarding pavilions  from hundreds of years ago.They can walk across garden bridges and look down into the quiet ponds. People can even go to the top of a 50 foot tall arrangement of rocks. From the top they can see the whole garden. Exquisite Jade Rock is the most popular sight in the garden. The rock is about 10 feet high and has 72 holes. Tourists love to watch when water is poured over the top of the rock, it flows out all 72 holes.  The best shopping in China is on Nanjing Road. This shopping area starts at one end of the Bund and goes for about four miles. Specialty shops and large malls line both sides of Nanjing Road. Better stores like Tiffany and Mont Blanc sit side by side with McDonalds and Pizza Hut. Yet you can still find traditional Chinese goods like silk and jade products. A train takes tourists up and down this lively road. In the evening visitors can hear the music playing in the open air restaurants and see the stores glowing with lights.To get a more dramatic view of the old and the new buildings of Shanghai, tourists can take a cruise down the Huangpu River. The trip takes about 50 minutes. From one side of the boat visitors can see the Bund lined with colonial style buildings. On the other side is the exciting skyline of modern Shanghai. A night time cruise adds the beauty of colored lights washing over the buildings. \n",

      "https://www.really-learn-english.com/english-reading-comprehension-smallest-countries-in-europe.html\n",
      "The total number of countries in Europe currently stands at 50, with some countries like Russia spreading across several time zones. Others, however, are so small it would be possible to walk or cycle along their borders in less than a day. In spite of their size, each of these countries has something very special to offer to the curious tourists. In Latin, Vatica or Vaticum means \"garden\", and this country got its name from the general area where it is located, which the Romans called \"garden territory\".Located in the heart of Rome, Vatican is  the smallest country in the world. This city-state, also known as the Holy See,  is the Pope's home and the center of the Catholic Church. Although it occupies  only 0.17 square miles (0.44 km2), Vatican City is densely populated with  its 1,000 residents. The biggest church in the world, St. Peter's Basilica,  holding important Christian art works, is also located there. Because the  country has no industry, the economy of Vatican City is supported by selling  post stamps, souvenirs and publications, and charging admission fees to enter  museums.The Greek word monoikos means \"single house\", a term used to described a Greek colony which lived nearby in the 6th century BC. It is believed that Hercules had passed through the Monaco area, and due to this, a temple called Hercules Monoikos was built. Since then, the whole city became known as Monoikos, or Monaco. Lying on the Mediterranean Sea coast,  Monaco is one the richest countries in the world, known for its luxury hotels  and casinos. With the area of merely 0.78 square miles (2.02 km2), Monaco  is also one of the most culturally diverse countries, since 125 nationalities  live there. It's known as the \"tax haven\" and a favorite location of the rich  and famous, due to its lenient tax laws. This tiny monarchy has been ruled by  the same family – the House of Grimaldi – since 1297.This country takes its name from a stonemason called San Marinus (meaning Saint Marinus), who worked in the city of Rimini in modern-day Italy, but went on to create an independent community which is today San Marino. (A stonemason is someone who makes things from stone.)  Spreading across 24 square  miles (61 km2), San Marino is another country existing within  the borders of Italy. Having gained independence from the Roman Empire in 301  AD, San Marino is one of the oldest sovereign nations in the world, and is  governed by the Constitution of San Marino, a compilation of six books in Latin  written in the 16th century. San Marino has one of the lowest  unemployment rates in Europe, no national debt, and more vehicles than people.Liechtenstein is named after the Liechtenstein family. The family owned the Castle Liechtenstein in Austria. The name of the castle means \"bright stone\", composed of the German words licht, meaning \"light\" and stein, meaning \"stone\".  The richest country in the world based on  GDP per capita (person), Liechtenstein is a monarchy bordering Switzerland and  Austria. Being located in the Alps, this is a popular winter sport destination,  although getting in is made more complicated by the fact that there are no airports  in the country. The 62 square miles (160 km2) big  territory got its name from the Liechtenstein dynasty, formed in 1699, and it is  in fact still ruled by one of the Liechtenstein princes. Their art collections  are on exhibit at the Liechtenstein Museum in Vienna.It is believed that the ancient Greeks called this island Melite, meaning \"honey-sweet\", probably because Malta is home to special bees which produce unique honey. Located south of Italy, Malta is an  archipelago in the Mediterranean Sea. This European Union country covers only  122 square miles (316 km2) and hosts some 450,000 people. Because  of its favorable location, historically Malta was a naval base with great  strategic importance. Twelve different nations had ruled this island before its  independence. Malta's beaches, history and nature attract tourists in large  numbers. One of the main attractions was the Azure Window, a 92 feet (28m) tall  natural arch on the island of Gozo; however, due to very stormy weather in  March, 2017, both the slab and the pillar collapsed. The origin of this country's name is not certain. It is possible that Andosini, the previous form of the name, derives from handia, which in the Basque language means \"big\" or \"giant\". According to a different theory, the name might have been given by the occupying Muslim forces, since al-durra means \"the forest\" in Arabic.  Standing between France and Spain, Andorra  is a landlocked country, created under a charter in 988. Occupying the area of  only 181 square miles (468 km2), Andorra is headed by both the Bishop of  Urgell in Spain and President of France. Built 3,356 feet (1,023 m) above sea  level, Andorra la Vella is the highest capital city in Europe. The residents of  Andorra, some 80,000 of them, have the highest life expectancy in the world at  81 years. Tourists can use Euro as a currency, and speak in Spanish or French;  yet, the official language is Catalan, spoken in the area around Barcelona in  Spain.Some believe that the name Luxembourg comes from a small castle called Lucilinburhuc (meaning \"small castle\" in Latin), which was located in the Luxembourg area at the time the country was founded. Although small and surrounded by important  European countries France, Germany and Belgium, Luxembourg is a powerful  country. Luxembourg City is one of the three official capitals of the European  Union, and the seat of the European Court of Justice, the highest judicial  authority in the union. This is partly because Luxembourg was very willing to  mediate between France and Germany in World War II, which led to a long-lasting  peace in Europe. With the area of 998 square miles (2,586 km2), this  rather small country invites tourists to enjoy its fairytale-like castles and  fortresses, historic monuments and picturesque sights.The  name of this  island may come from the word kypros meaning \"copper\", as copper  was discovered on the island during the Bronze period (2500 B.C -1050 B.C).  Thanks to copper, Cyprus became a well-known country at that time. This  Mediterranean island, located south of Turkey and north of Egypt, is where some  of the earliest human activity happened in the 10th millennium BC. Once  under British administration, the 3,572 square miles (9,251 km2) big  island is now divided between Turkish Cypriots and those who speak Greek. Major  cities on both sides have airports, so the island is accessible all year round.  Archaeological sites are scattered around the island, and the beaches are  always busy. Cyprus is particularly famous for its strong wines, jewelry and  leather products. \n",

      "South America is a continent made out of 12 different countries, famous for football, carnivals, numerous tourist attractions and delicious food. With their rich history and diverse populations, South American countries offer delicious traditional dishes suited for everyone's taste and budget. Sopa de mondongo is one of the soups  that are eaten across the continent. They are many variations of this  slow-cooked tripe (cow's or pig's stomach) and vegetables soup. While in  Colombia this soup is considered to be an addition to a larger meal, the Venezuelans  see this soup as being too heavy for the stomach, so they eat it as the main  course.  Sea  food is eaten all over South America. In Brazil, fish stew called Moqueca is particularly popular. This  dish is made with salt water fish, and optionally served with prawns. Records  show that people in Brazil have been making this dish for at least 300 years.Fun fact: Paraguayan dish called sopa paraguaya (Paraguyan soup) is  actually not a soup, but a spongy corn cake, made with cheese and milk.  Originating  from Peru, ceviche is one of the  dishes whose popularity has spread across the world. This very unique dish is  typically made from fresh raw fish cured in lemon or lime juice. Although it is  delicious, you must be very careful with this dish, because not preparing and  consuming it fresh could lead to food poisoning. Churrasco refers to beef or, more  generally, grilled meat, sometimes also called asado in countries such as Uruguay. In Chile, churrasco sandwich is  accompanied with tomato, avocado and mayonnaise, while churrasco a lo pobre (poor man's churrasco) is eaten with French  fries, fried egg and onions. Churrascarias are popular fast food restaurants which serve all-you-can-eat grilled meat  for a fixed price.  South  Americans love desserts. In Brazil, the most popular ones are brigadeiros. This dessert can come in  different colors and flavors, but the base is always the same: sweetened  condensed milk is heated with cocoa power until they form a paste, which is  then rolled into small balls, and covered with toppings such as sprinkles or coconut  shavings. Brigadeiros are often served at birthday parties.Picarones, originating from Peru, are  one of the oldest desserts, dating back to Peru's colonial days. Since there  are more than 3,800 types of potatoes growing in Peru, desserts are often made  with potatoes. Sweet potato, mixed with squash, is used for picarones. In  combination with flour, sweet potatoes are turned into light and airy deep-fried  doughnuts and served with syrup.Fun fact: Wheat did not grow in South  America, so white flour was very expensive. Two Venezuelan sisters invented a  cake that did not need flour, but was based on mashed plantains (bananas) and  corn instead. The cake, called Torta Bejarana,  is still very popular, normally showered with sesame seeds.\n",

      "53-Summer Solstice\n",
      "https://www.really-learn-english.com/english-reading-comprehension-summer-solstice.html\n",
      "The longest day of the year is called the  summer solstice. In the Northern Hemisphere, the summer solstice happens on  June 20 or 21, when the sun's path reaches its farthest north position. This  day also marks the beginning of the summer for this part of the world. For  people in the Southern Hemisphere, this happens exactly six months later on or  around December 21, when the sun is in the farthest south. Because the sun's  path is the longest of all, the summer solstice is the day when there is most  daylight and, therefore, the night is the shortest. From this day on, nights  slowly become longer, while days grow shorter for six months until the winter  solstice happens. The word solstice comes from Latin sol, meaning \"sun\", and sistere, meaning \"to stand still\";  however, the summer solstice is also known as \"midsummer\" in many cultures,  because it is considered to be closer to the middle of summer than the  beginning of it. Festivals and holidays relating to the summer solstice started  before Christianity. In ancient times, bonfires were lit on the night of the  summer solstice because it was believed that evil spirits roamed freely as the  sun was turning towards the south.  However, for Christians, this date also marks  the birth of John the Baptist, an early Christian martyr (a person killed for  their religious beliefs). For this reason, midsummer is celebrated as St.  John's Day in a great number of European countries.\n",
      "  For the ancient Romans, the summer  solstice was important as a day devoted to Summanus, the god of nocturnal (of the night) thunder.  On June 20, 278 BC, the temple  of Summanus was dedicated in the city of Rome. The night before the summer  solstice, the Romans used to make wheel-shaped cakes called summanalia, which may have represented the sun. Usually, two dark animals such as black oxen were offered to Summanus as a  sacrifice. This temple was struck by lightning in 197 BC.  Iran's midsummer festival Tirgan dates  back to the ancient times. Initially, Tirgan was dedicated to Tir (or Tishtar),  the god of rain. Celebrated on the day of the summer solstice, this festival gave  Iranians an opportunity to pray to this god for a year without drought. In  today's Iran, Tigran festival starts in early July, in accordance with the  Iranian calendar. Because it is associated with the god of rain, Tirgan is  celebrated by splashing water. Furthermore, children are given rainbow-colored  bands to tie on their wrists and wear for ten days, after which they throw them  into a stream. Sholezard, a  rice-based dessert flavored with saffron and rose water, is traditionally  served on Tirgan.\n",
      "  The midsummer's eve, which generally falls  on June 21, is popularly celebrated in Northern Europe. It is a national  holiday in Sweden and Finland. In Sweden, this holiday, known as  Midsommarafton (\"Midsummer Eve\" in Swedish), is observed for the entire week, starting on June 19. One of  the traditions specific for this holiday is the gathering of people around a  maypole, a tall wooden pole decorated with flowers, and singing and dancing.  This event has ancient roots, and old Scandinavians probably performed it to  celebrate fertility. The Danish equivalent of this holiday is called Sankt Hans  Aften (St. John's Eve). In this country, the midsummer's eve is celebrated with traditional  foods such as smoked or pickled fish and strawberries. To honor their ancient  roots, people also often light a bonfire and sing around it.In  present-day Wales, there are two holidays associated with St John. St John's Night of Midsummer (Gwyl Ifan Ganol Haf in Welsh) is celebrated on the night of the summer solstice. Another similar holiday happens on the night of the winter  solstice and is called St John's Night of Midwinter (Gwyl Ifan Ganol Gaeaf in Welsh). Yet, these Welsh traditions goes back to the pagan Celtic people who marked the  midpoint of summer by lighting huge bonfires to protect themselves against the  evil spirits and jumping over the flame, hoping the highest jump would mark the  height of that year's corn. These kinds of celebrations were noted all over  Britain. More traditionally in Wales agricultural fairs were held on this day, with  much dancing and drinking. In the past several decades, a great folk dancing  festival called Gwyl Ifan is organized in the capital city of Cardiff. The  festival welcomes folk dancers from all around the world, who jointly celebrate  midsummer. \n",
      "54-Welcome to Taipei \n",
      "https://www.really-learn-english.com/english-reading-comprehension-taipei.html\n",
      "Taipei is the capital of Taiwan and an exciting blend of modern and traditional. About three million people or one third of the total population of Taiwan live in Taipei. Here visitors can see one of the world's tallest skyscrapers and ancient temples. Modern restaurants and traditional night markets serve food for all appetites. For fun, locals like to sing karaoke, a Japanese style of singing modern songs, or they can go to classical music performances.   Taiwan is an island near the southeast coast of China. The Strait of Taiwan, a channel of water 180 km (110 miles) wide, separates Taiwan from China. The people of Taiwan call their island \"The Sweet Potato\" because of its small round shape. The official language is Mandarin Chinese. The government of Taiwan calls itself the Republic of China. Taiwan says that it represents all the Chinese people. The People's Republic of China disagrees with this statement. There is much tension between Taiwan and China, but the people of Taiwan have lived in peace for many years. During this time, the economy has grown and the people enjoy high levels of education and health care.  The National Palace Museum has one of the largest collections  of Chinese artifacts in the world. The Museum contains over 650,000 pieces of  Chinese art. Only a small part of the collection is on display at one time  because the collection is so big! Visitors can see Chinese calligraphy,  porcelain, and paintings dating back almost 10,000 years. Many of these  artifacts were chosen by Chinese emperors for their personal collections.  Popular objects to see in the museum are a jade sculpture in the shape of a  cabbage, a bronze bell made for a king, and a stone shaped like a piece of  meat.  Longshan Temple, a Buddhist temple built in 1738, is one of  the most important sites in Taipei for architectural and religious reasons. The  temple building mixes a traditional Chinese courtyard design with the design of  a palace. The outside of the building has curved lines and colorful dragons and  birds that look down from the roof.  Fancy  stone and wood shapes decorate the walls. Longshan is also important as a place  of worship. The temple was built to honor the god of mercy, but altars for  hundreds of gods and goddesses line the sides and back of the temple. Visitors  come every day to listen as crowds of religious people sing prayers or chant  early in the morning and late in the afternoon.  A huge stalk of bamboo looks out over the city. That's  Taipei 101, a skyscraper shaped like a stalk of bamboo. For years, Taipei 101  was the tallest building in the world. Visitors go to shop, to get a sky high  view of the city, or just to ride the thrilling elevator. The first five floors  of the building contain one of the fanciest malls in town. On the 90th  floor tourists can walk around the outdoor observation deck and see  breath-taking views of the city and mountains. Even the ride up to the  observation deck is exciting. The elevator zooms up the 90 floors in only 40  seconds!  A short ride from Taipei sits Yangmingshan National Park,  one of nine national parks in Taiwan.A  popular attraction in the park is the historical Zhongshan Building. The  classical sloping green roof and bright white walls of Zhongshan make a  stunning picture set against the hills of the park. The building honors the  first president of Taiwan. A picture of Zhongshan Building was recently put on  Taiwan's one-hundred dollar bill. To enjoy the natural beauty of the park, visitors  can take a guided tour. They learn about the volcanic activity which formed the  terrain of the park. They can walk around an extinct volcano and feel the gas  and steam that still escapes from underground. Hiking trails bring walkers  through a bamboo forest out to a field called the Valley of the Sun. Hikers  view a peaceful field dotted with cattle grazing on thick green grass. Another  peaceful area of the park is Bamboo Lake where a 13 hectare (32 acre) field of  flowers blossoms at different times of the year to the delight of visitors.  Drinking and eating the way the locals do is a great way to  experience the fun personality of Taipei.  Visitors should try bubble tea, a tea drink mixed with tapioca balls and  milk. Tea houses all over the city serve many variations of bubble tea. This  drink is probably Taiwan's most famous export. People in North America and many  other countries now love bubble tea too. For dining, Taipei is famous for its  night markets. On certain streets outdoor vendors serve snacks from late at  night until early morning. Students and office workers gather at the night  markets to snack and socialize with their friends. Shilin Night market is  probably the most famous night market in Taiwan. Here brave tourists can snack  like the locals on a Taiwan specialty – stinky bean curd (a thick soft substance that is formed when milk turns sour).A fun way to see many of these attractions plus  more is by bicycle. Visitors can join an 8 hour bicycle tour around the city  and through the down town area. The tour stops at 20 popular attractions  including a traditional breakfast restaurant (food is included in the price of  the tour), Longshan Temple, Taipei 101, and many others. Riders can get a  little tired on the tour so the guides try to go slow and take breaks. Still,  many people like the shorter tours better. They get to see a lot of the city by  bicycle, but they also have time after the tour to do what they please.\n",
      "55-Tbilisi\n",
      "https://www.really-learn-english.com/english-reading-comprehension-tbilisi.html\n",
      "Tbilisi is the capital and largest city of Georgia. It lies on the banks of the Kura River. The city has a history going back at least 1500 years. It is one of the most important cities in the Caucasus region. It is often thought of as one of the most important meeting points of European and Asian cultures. The name Tbilisi translates from the Old Georgian languages as \"the warm place\". It is thought that this name was given to the town  because of the large number of hot springs in the surrounding area. These springs have provided clean and warm water to the city ever since. Narikala is one of Tbilisi's most historic sites. The fortress dates  back as far as the 4th century CE. It was first built by the  Persians, who called it \"the enviable fortress\". During Georgia's long history  it was also used by the Arabs, the Georgians, and the Mongols as a stronghold.  Narikala was one of the most important stops on the Silk Road. This trade route  brought goods such as silk, spices, and jewels from Asia to Europe. The  fortress was badly damaged by a major earthquake in 1827. Unfortunately, it has  never been fully restored. However its surviving towers and ruins are still among  the most beautiful sights in Georgia. Svetitskhoveli Cathedral is  a major site of worship for the Eastern Orthodox Church. This branch of  Christianity is the official religion of Georgia. A church has stood on this  site since the Early Middle Ages. It is recognized as a World Heritage Site by  UNESCO. It is most famous for being the supposed burial site of the mantle of  Jesus Christ. This is the piece of cloth that Christians believe that Jesus  wore when he was killed by the Romans. The cathedral building that stands now dates  back to the year 1029. Many of its most beautiful wall paintings were destroyed  during the Soviet period. This was because of the government's official policy  discouraging religious belief. However many of its most attractive features  have been restored since Georgia gained independence in 1991. This museum is one of the most  important museums in the city. It was first founded in the mid-19th  century as the museum of the Russian Imperial Geographic Society. It was built  to house the best examples of archeological findings from across the Caucasus region.  The museum was renamed in honor of the Georgian historian Simon Janashia in  1947. The museum's main exhibits tell the story of Georgia's remarkable history  through a number of different objects. These include collections of coins,  jewelry, and tools objects dating back as far as the Bronze Age. Agmashenebeli Avenue is one  of the most beautiful streets in the historical part of Tbilisi. The street is  best known for its 19th century classical architecture. It is named  after the family name of King David IV of Georgia. During the Imperial Russian  years, the street was known as Mikhail Street. Many of its most impressive  buildings, including the main Tbilisi Police Station, date back to this period.  Over seventy buildings on the street have been extensively renovated since  2010. \n",

      "https://www.really-learn-english.com/english-reading-comprehension-the-japanese-kimono.html\n",
      "\n",
      "Many nations have traditional styles of dress.  These are the  country's traditional fashions.  Kimonos came to Japan from China. They were worn underneath clothes as  an undergarment. \"Kimono\" was the Japanese word for clothing. Now however, the  word \"kimono\" refers to one type of Japanese dress.\n",
      "\n",
      "   \n",
      "\n",
      "  Kimonos are robes with long sleeves. The sleeves are very wide.  Kimonos are also shaped like a \"T.\"   People wear a very wide belt with their kimonos. This belt is called an  \"obi.\" They are traditionally wrapped around your body from left to right. In  fact, only the dead are wrapped right to left! There are different layers to  traditional kimonos.As you will learn, kimonos are a very important part of Japanese  history.Kimonos became popular during the Heian period (the  period from 794-1192). Before that, Japanese people wore a different style of  clothing. They wore pants and shirts of different materials. During the Heian  period, a different type of clothing began being made. People began cutting  clothes in straight lines and sewing them together. This style of making clothes gave makers plenty of freedom.  Seamstresses (women whose job is making clothes) didn't have to worry about  size or body shape. Kimonos are made in all the same size for women, and all  the same size for men. They are folded and tucked to make them fit each person.  These kimonos were easy to fold compared to other traditional clothes. And  different fabrics made kimonos suitable for all weather. Thick fabrics could be  used for winter and thin linen for summer. Kimonos were very popular for a long time. As they began getting more  popular, people became interested in different colors and fabrics. They matched  bright fabrics with seasons. Also, in the past you could match colors to social  and political class. By looking at someone's kimono, you could tell what part  of society they belonged to.In the western world and other countries, people wear a lot of  accessories. They may wear jewelry like rings and necklaces. People often wear  hats and fancy shoes. The Japanese did not dress like this, however. Instead,  they expressed their style and taste with the fabric of their kimono. Kimono  designers used their fabric as a canvas. Like an artist who paints pictures,  people would design very elegant images on their fabric. Some kimonos were even  painted with ink!Warriors on the battlefield also wore very bright and colorful  kimonos. Soldiers paid lots of attention to their dress. They wore extravagant  outfits! The color of a warrior's kimono showed what part of the army he  belonged to. At one point in time, kimonos involved 25 different layers of  fabric! Can you imagine having to put on 25 layers of clothes? Kimonos were  taken very seriously and involved lots of work. Kimonos became more and more popular and the practice of making  kimonos became an art form. These traditional dresses became very valuable and  parents passed them down to their children as valuable gifts. While soldiers and government officials dressed in particular colors  to show class, normal citizens wore kimonos to show their family. They would  put their family crest on their kimonos. During traditional ceremonies, they  would wear these kimonos to show which family they belonged to. Married women had a different style of kimono than single women and  mothers also had to teach their daughters how to wear kimonos. Putting a kimono  on was a difficult process. Nowadays, there are schools that teach you how to  properly wear a kimono. There are many reasons why the kimono became less popular. Western  countries influenced Japan. This made people adopt western style clothing. At  one point, people in government were made to wear pants and jackets. They were  not allowed to wear kimonos! This is no longer a rule.Now the most popular fabric to make kimonos with is silk. Silk is an  expensive fabric. The cost of the fabric has made kimonos much less popular these  days. A kimono could cost you thousands of dollars! And the belt (obi) could be  even more expensive. This has made the kimono less popular than in history.  Today if you travel to Japan, you will not see as many as you did in the past.  However, many tourists and Japanese locals like to dress up in kimonos for fun. Kimonos are still worn for traditional ceremonies, as well. You may  find Japanese couples getting married wearing kimonos. They are also worn to  funerals. The Japanese wear black kimonos to funerals. And men getting married  wear black kimonos too. In the past, women wore kimonos while doing traditional  arts such as tea ceremonies. They are often worn now to summer festivals.The western world has adopted the traditional Japanese kimono. If you  go into a clothing store in the United States and ask for a kimono, you will be  given a long light fabric robe. It is a popular fashion for young women.However, traditional kimono fabric designers are considered very  important in Japan. Their kimonos sell like an expensive painting. They create  unique masterpieces. While most modern Japanese people do not own kimonos, they are still  an important part of Japanese culture. They played a very big part in Japanese  history. They are also instantly recognizable as a Japanese icon!\n",

      "Greece is everyone's favorite location with its islands and sand beaches. Thessaloniki, the second biggest city in Greece, is the country's hidden gem on the coast of the Aegean Sea (tThe Aegean Sea is a part of the Mediterranean Sea, between Greece and Turkey).It is one of the oldest cities in Europe, and it has very well-preserved buildings to prove it. You will fall in love with everything in this city – its warm weather, delicious food, hospitable local people and ancient Greek history.   White Tower is the symbol of Thessaloniki, found on nearly all souvenirs. It was built where an old Byzantine fortification once stood, and it now represents a central structure on Thessaloniki's charming 12 km-long waterfront. It serves a museum and is open for tourists, who can enjoy a stunning view of the waterfront and the bay in front of it from the tower's roof. The museum offers a comprehensive timeline of the important events that happened in the past 2,000 years, so it is a perfect starting point for those who are interested in Thessaloniki's history.The Arch of  Galerius and the Rotunda are early 4th-century monuments standing  next to each other at a place known as Kamara.  Considering how old they are, these Roman-era monuments are incredibly well-preserved.  The arch once symbolized the power of the Roman emperor, while the Rotunda has  had many different uses throughout the history, having served as a temple, a  Christian basilica, and an Ottoman mosque. Today, Rotunda is an archaeological  site and a museum. In addition to being of great historical value, these  structures are also famous for being a favorite meeting spot of the students  living in Thessaloniki.Not far from  Kamara, Aristotelous Square, the biggest square in the city, is located. This  square, named after Greek philosopher Aristotle, lies in the heart of the city,  stretching from the shopping avenue of Egnatia all the way to the waterfront. It is surrounded by twelve buildings of the  Hellenic Republic. The square is frequently used for cultural events, such as  the annual Christmas celebration, which gathers people from all over the  country. It is a place where you can shop, eat at some of the most expensive  restaurants in the city, go to a theater, or simply sit on a bench and feed pigeons.In Thessaloniki,  street food is not only very popular, but also incredibly affordable. If you're  a meat lover, you should definitely try gyros,  a pita bread with chicken or pork, salad and French fries, guaranteed to keep  your belly full. If you have a sweet tooth, simply walk into any of the  patisseries you see in the city center – they all make equally delicious  pastries! One of the locals' favorites is definitely tsoureki, a sweet, egg-enriched bread, sometimes covered in chocolate. Tsoureki is traditionally  eaten for Easter, but tourists can buy it all year round. Being in a country which  has access to three different seas, Thessaloniki is a perfect place to enjoy  some sea food. Go to a local restaurant, and try gemista kalamarakia (stuffed squid), or mydopilafo, Thessaloniki's classic rice with mussels. This great  experience is made even better by the free dessert you will get in the end!\n",

      "No other city in the world accommodates more people in its metropolitan area than Tokyo. With more than 37 million residents, over a dozen different metro lines, thousands of cherry trees, and an active volcano of Mount Fuji lying on its southern outskirts, Japan's capital is an incomparable city. Two biggest religions in Japan are  Shintoism and Buddhism, and Tokyo expectedly hosts a great number of religious temples.  Some of the most notable ones are located in Asakusa, a part of the downtown Taito  district of Tokyo. Sensoji, the largest  Buddhist temple in the city, is the main attraction in Asakusa. This temple is  famous for its Kaminarimon (or \"Thunder Gate\") gate, decorated with a giant  lantern and statues of two guardian gods. After passing this gate and the main  Hozomon gate, the Kannon Hall, originally built in 628, stands crowded with  worshippers. In Asakusa, it is also possible to visit a Shinto shrine called Asakusa Jinja, where the Tokyo's  largest festival Sanja Matsuri takes place every May, attracting up to 2  million visitors. Chingodo Shrine,  dedicated to tanuki, a raccoon-like  character from Japanese folklore, is also situated in this neighborhood.  The long tradition of Japanese Imperial  Family still continues, although these days the political power of the Emperor  is limited and symbolic. The primary residence of the Emperor, called Imperial  Palace, is located in Tokyo. Built on the site of the Edo Castle, the modern  palace is mostly used for receptions and other imperial court functions. The  Imperial Family of Japan also lives in this complex, surrounded by the  beautiful Eukiage Gardens. Special guided tours are allowed only two days a  week, but every January 2 and on Emperor's Birthday (December 23) all people  are invited to come in, where the Imperial Family greets them from the palace's  balcony. Within the imperial complex, there are also several parks which are  open to the public all year long.  Another top tourist attraction is the  Meiji Shrine, dedicated to Emperor Meiji and his wife Empress Shoken. The  shrine complex was built shortly after the emperor died in 1912, in a garden  area the emperor and his wife used to visit. The whole area is in fact a large  forest, covered by more than 120,000 trees of 365 species, most of them donated  by people from all parts of Japan. Besides the shrine, there is a treasure  museum with personal belongings of the Emperor and Empress, a memorial picture  gallery, and a memorial hall, nowadays used for Shinto weddings.What  makes Tokyo especially beautiful is the old Japanese tradition of cherry  blossom appreciation. In springtime, white and pink flowers of cherry trees,  called sakura in Japanese, decorate  the entire city. The ancient practice of sitting and picnicking under a  blooming sakura tree is called hanami.  When the blossoms finally appear, the whole city goes out to celebrate. Cherry  blossom is often presented as a symbol of Japan, especially on paintings.\n",

      "60-Types of Climate\n",
      "https://www.really-learn-english.com/english-reading-comprehension-types-of-climate.html\n",
      "The weather can be truly unpredictable. It  can change day-to-day, or even hour-to-hour. Nevertheless, we can still notice certain  weather patterns. We know when to expect snow, or when to book our summer  holiday. These weather patterns, distinct from one region to another, are  called climate. There are several classification systems  designed for climate types. The most popular one is called the Köppen system.  Wladimir Köppen was a Russian-German scientist who, in 1900, proposed a method  which studies vegetation (all the plants found in an area), temperature, and  precipitation to group different climate regions. The tropical climate is hot and humid,  usually with an abundant rainfall. This high level of temperature is maintained  with little variation throughout the year.  There are three types of tropical climate:  Tropical wet  climates are unique for  places known as rain forests. These  regions are located around the equator, and have the most predictable weather  pattern of all – temperatures are consistently high throughout the year, and  rain falls regularly.   Places with tropical wet climate are, for  example, Hawaii, or Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia. A monsoon is a wind in  southern Asia that brings heavy rains in the summer. Tropical monsoon  climates are characterized by this wind system, called monsoon, which changes its  direction twice a year – from sea to land in the summer, and from land to sea  in the winter.   In places with tropical monsoon climates  like India and Bangladesh, people's crops growth relies on the seasonal rains  brought by summer monsoons.   Tropical wet and  dry climates have three seasons: Cuba  and parts of Africa can experience drought when very little rain falls, or  floods when there is too much rain. Dry climate is specific for regions with  low precipitation (rain and snow). Based on how much rain falls, there are two dry climate  types: arid and semiarid. Arid means very dry and with little or no rain.  Arid climates are unique for  deserts and cover nearly 33% of the planet.Some of the hottest places on  Earth, like Libya, where the temperature reached 136° F (58°  C), have an arid climate.   To be categorized as an arid  climate type, a region must receive less than 10 inches (25.4 cm) of rain per  year, although many of them do not get that much rain in 10 years! Semi means half or partly.  Semi-arid climates are the  next driest type of climate. They receive slightly more rainfall – 10-20 inches  (25-50cm) per year.  Semi-arid climates are  further split into two types: hot and cold. The  regions with semiarid climates always surround arid climate regions. There is  sometimes enough rain to support farming, but often there is drought. The city  of Denver in Colorado is a representative of this climate type. Mild or temperate means not too hot and  not too cold.  Temperate climates are those without  extremes of temperature and precipitation (rain and snow). These areas are usually mid-way  between the equator and the poles. They are often found near a warm ocean or  sea.   There are three types of mild climates:  The  Mediterranean type's characteristics are warm summers with little or no rain,  and short, mild  winters. Places with this climate are located along the Mediterranean Sea.   Humid  subtropical climates have more rain, spread throughout the year, and colder winters.  Sometimes, big storms and even hurricanes can occur. These places include  Sydney in Australia and Shanghai in China.Marine means relating to the sea.  The Marine West  Coast type, typically found on western coasts of continents, is affected by the  presence of mountains. The temperatures in places like Seattle, the US, or  Wellington, New Zealand (which have this climate type) do not change much. In  addition, there is an abundance of precipitation throughout the year, and the  sky is often cloudy.In continental climate zones, winters are  colder and longer, and the differences in weather conditions from one season to  another are more drastic. In general, all three continental climate types are  only found in the Northern Hemisphere, in Europe, Russia, and North America.  This type of climate is called continental  because it is typical of the interior of a continent, where there are no nearby  oceans to moderate weather conditions.  The humid  continental climate type is defined by four seasons. Summer is warm, rainy, and  humid, fall is cool and dry, winter is harsh and cold and, and spring is warm  and wet.  Most of Eastern Europe has this climate.   Places in the European part of Russia,  which have cool summer climates,  traditionally witness very low temperatures and snow in the winter, and mild,  cool summers.Alaska,  Scandinavia, Siberia, and parts of Canada have subarctic climates, known for  very long, dark, cold winters, and short summers. Polar means \"connected  with the North or South Pole or near them\". The polar climate is found near the  Poles.  There are two types of polar  climates: the tundra and the ice cap. These climate types have the lowest  temperatures on Earth.  A tundra is a large, flat area of land with only low growing  plants. It is found in very cold regions of earth. Tree growth is difficult  there because of the cold temperatures.  Tundra climates are found along the coast  of the Arctic Ocean in the north. They have short and mild summers, but are  still very rich in animal and plant life. These are the places where polar  bears and reindeers live.   The ice cap is a layer of ice  covering parts of the earth around the North and South Poles.Very  few organisms can survive in the ice cap climate. Both the Arctic (the North  Pole and its surroundings) and Antarctic (the South Pole and its surroundings)  have this climate type. It is not uncommon that everything stays frozen even  during the summer, and there is very little rain. When it comes to animals,  penguins are known to be fond of this climate type. \n",

      "https://www.really-learn-english.com/english-reading-comprehension-vienna.html\n",
      "Vienna, Austria's largest and most populous city, has historically been the capital of culture for Western Europe. This city is home to a great number of museums, galleries and cultural events. It is a place where famous composers such as Mozart and Beethoven lived and created their best music. A perfect mixture of the old and the new, Vienna is a city where going to the opera, having a piece of chocolate cake and shopping are only a few of the must-do activities. Formerly a summer house of the Habsburgs, the Austrian royal family, Schönbrunn Palace is the most visited attraction in Vienna. The Palace has 1,441 rooms and it now serves as a museum. Some rooms are open for public and display the original furniture used by the Habsburgs centuries ago. In addition to the museum, the Schönbrunn royal complex also consists of beautiful gardens, a maze (a place where it is difficult to find your way out), Roman ruins, and numerous sculptures. The world's oldest zoo, Tiergarten Schönbrunn, is also easily accessible from the royal complex.Located in the city center, this imperial palace was used by the Habsburg family as their main winter residence. The Hofburg complex was built in the 13th century to serve as the seat of the government. Over the years, there were many additions to the palace, such as the imperial chapel, the library and the Burgtheater (the Imperial Court Theatre). When in the Hofburg, you will have a chance to see a number of attractions  all at once.   St. Stephen's Cathedral stands tall on the ruins of two small churches built 1,000 years ago. With its colorful roof, the church represents one of the symbols of Vienna and its incredibly rich history. Both locals and tourists gather in great numbers in the area around the church to admire its beauty. Due to its 18 altars, several chapels and many gilded icons, the interior of the church is also quite stunning and definitely worth visiting.The Museumsquartier is one of the largest art and culture complexes in the world. When the place opened in 2001, several new museums were introduced to the city. Once there, you can get lost in one of the art museums like the Leopold Museum or the Museum of Modern Art, or instead choose to see contemporary exhibition spaces. In any case, the Museumsquartier is a perfect destination for all art lovers, and a symbol of modernity and innovation in Vienna.\n",

      "https://www.really-learn-english.com/english-reading-comprehension-vientian.html\n",
      "Laos, a small landlocked country in Southeast Asia, has increasingly become popular as a tourist destination. Its capital, Vientiane, will charm you with its beautiful riverside, sunsets and hospitable locals. Due to its turbulent history and various past occupations, Vientiane is home to many different styles of architecture. Separated from Thailand by the Mekong River, Vientiane is a perfect choice for any tourist who wants to learn more about Buddhism and Southeast Asian cultures.    Pha That Lung is the most important national monument and the symbol of Laos. Covered in gold, this large structure represents a Buddhist stupa, a place used for meditation. Originating in the 1st century as a Hindu temple, the Great Stupa was ruined and rebuilt several times. Today, Pha That Luang consists of three levels, each reflecting an important part of the Buddhist teachings. It is a place where you can enjoy some quiet time in the city, since any traffic in and around the complex is prohibited. In Lao, Patuxai means Victory Gate, and it is a perfect name to describe  this stunning war monument dedicated to the people who fought for independence  from France. The monument is beautifully decorated with mythological creatures  like the kinnari (half-female,  half-bird). Patuxai was built during an unstable period in Laotian history  using American funds which were originally given to build a new airport.   Built in 1818, Wat Si Saket has served as an important Buddhist temple in Vientiane. Due to its distinct Siamese style of Buddhist architecture, the Siamese armies used it as their headquarters during the occupation. Following the 1827 rebellion, many buildings in the city were destroyed, but Wat Si Saket kept standing. For this reason, it is believed to be the oldest temple that exists in its original form in Vientiane. Another reason to visit this temple is its remarkable collection of more than 2,000 ceramic and silver images of Buddha.  If you are interested to see how modern ideas interact with traditions, Buddha Park is the place to be. This park hosts an outdoor collection of over 200 huge sculptures of both Buddhist and Hindu gods, as well as of some imaginary beasts. Built just outside Vientiane, the Buddha Park is also very close to the Friendship Bridge which connects Laos and Thailand over the Mekong River.Besides visiting these tourist  attractions, there are a number of other interesting things you might want to try  out in Vientiane.\n",
      "63-Winter Holidays Around the World\n",
      "https://www.really-learn-english.com/english-reading-comprehension-winter-holidays.html\n",
      "Holidays are special days for the people of one nation or culture, which are set aside by the law or through a custom, and on which everyday activities, such as work or school, are normally suspended. Every country has several important holidays, which can be national (important for the state), religious (important for a particular religious group), or simply cultural (such as celebrating the beginning of a season, for example). Many holidays are celebrated in the winter, which is why this period is also known as \"the holiday season\". Hanukkah is an eight-day long Jewish  holiday which commemorates the successful rebellion of the Jewish people (167 to 160 BC), who  reclaimed the Holy Temple in Jerusalem. Because Jewish people follow the lunar  calendar, the first day of Hanukkah falls on a different date each year,  however, it is always in winter. This holiday is marked by lighting eight  candles – one each night - on a hanukkiah,  a special  lampstand. This tradition is respected because it is believed that  when the control over the Temple was regained, the lampstand put there burned for  eight days, even though there was enough oil only for one day. This is also why  on Hanukkah people eat a lot of oil-based food, such as latkes (potato pancakes eaten with sour cream or cheese), and  special doughnuts.   Commemorated on December 13, St. Lucia's  Day is one of the biggest winter celebrations in Sweden, based on the stories  told by the first Christian monks in the country. St. Lucia was a young girl  killed for her Christian faith by the Romans. Her name means \"light\" and it is  believed that she wore candles on her head while she was carrying food to other  Christians hiding underground. Nowadays, Swedish girls wear white dresses and a  crown of candles on their heads to honor St. Lucia. Green branches on the crowns  are meant to symbolize new life in spite of the harsh winter weather. Lussekatts, buns flavored with saffron  and raisins, are a special breakfast treat eaten on this day.  Christmas is the biggest annual holiday  for the Christian world, celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ. In most of the  world, it is commemorated on December 25, however, many Eastern Orthodox  churches use a different calendar, so, for this reason, they celebrate  Christmas on January 7. In addition to its religious importance, Christmas has  also been adopted as a cultural holiday by many non-Christians. Each country  has unique Christmas traditions, but nearly all of them include a large family  gathering, decorating the house, exchanging gifts and having a long feast. In  some European countries, people go caroling,  that is, singing special Christmas songs on the street. It has also become  popular to decorate a Christmas tree, both inside the house, and on city  squares.  Mexican people traditionally celebrate  Christmas for twelve days – from Christmas evening on December 24th,  to the Three Kings Day on January 6th (also called the Epiphany. Epiphany  literally means a sudden  moment of understanding).The Three Kings Day commemorates the  end of these celebrations. This holiday was inspired by the biblical story of  the three kings from the East (also referred to as three Wise Men or Magi), \n",
      "\n",
      "  who spotted a bright star in the sky the night  Jesus was born, and came to see baby Jesus. This holiday is so important for Mexicans that they often give  additional gifts on this day, even though it is shortly after Christmas.  Another custom specific for this holiday is baking the Rosca, a sweet bread ring in which a small baby Jesus figurine is placed.  Whoever finds the figurine has to host another holiday's party in February.  Having been created in 1966, Kwanzaa is the  first holiday specifically celebrated by the African-American diaspora. (Diaspora means the movement of people  away from their own country.) The  holiday honors African heritage among people living outside Africa, and the  celebrations last for a week – from December 26 to January 1. Its name means  \"first fruits\" in Swahili, an East African language. People who celebrate  Kwanzaa wear colorful African clothes, decorate their houses, and serve fresh  fruits. Before the feast, families usually discuss African history and culture,  and perform a candle-lighting ritual. During the week of Kwanzaa, many cultural  exhibitions are held, celebrating African dance, music and poetry.  Chinese New Year is the biggest holiday in  China, occurring on the last day of the last month of the Chinese calendar,  which does not coincide with the December 31st, but instead falls  between January 21st and February 20th. The celebrations  are held all over the country and normally last for two weeks, making it the  longest festival in China. During the celebrations, you can see incredible  decorations such as dragons, lanterns, flowers, as well as fireworks and people  dressed in traditional Chinese clothing. Windows and doors are usually  decorated with red color papercuts to symbolize good fortune, wealth and  longevity. This festival honors both Chinese deities (gods) and historical  figures.\n",
      "64-Winter Solstice\n",
      "https://www.really-learn-english.com/english-reading-comprehension-winter-solstice.html\n",
      "The shortest day (and the longest night)  of the year is called the winter solstice. This day marks the beginning of  winter, which is on or around December 21 in the Northern Hemisphere (North  America, Europe, Asia, and most of Africa) and on June 21 in the Southern  Hemisphere (Australia, nearly all of South America, and the southern part of  Africa). After the winter solstice, days become shorter while nights become  longer. The word solstice derives from Latin sol sistere which means \"sun standing  still\". The sun appears so low on the winter solstice that it does indeed look  like it is not moving at all.  Because our planet is tilted on the axis (an imaginary line of rotation) for some 23.5 degrees, the two hemispheres get  different amounts of sunlight during the year, as Earth keeps moving around the  sun. In the Northern Hemisphere, the December solstice happens when the sun's elevation  in the sky is at its lowest. On that day, some cities like Reykjavik, the  capital of Iceland, receive only 4 hours of daylight. Yet, in the South, places  like Melbourne in Australia can enjoy a 15-hour long sunny day.  The solstice has been a special event  since the earliest human history. People relied on the solstice to know when  animals mate, when to sow crops, or how to distribute their winter reserves of  food. In some cultures, it was an opportunity to make the last large feast of  the year, before the harsh winter began. Communities typically had the greatest  amount of food and beer to share with each other right at the start of the  winter. The  legendary ring of standing stones called Stonehenge is one of the landmark  attractions in England. Stonehenge was built in stages, some of them dating  back to 5,000 years ago. Consequently, it was also used for different purposes,  one of which was the observance of the winter solstice. The stones had been  carefully aligned to give a clear view of the sunset of the winter solstice, as  well as of the opposing sunrise of the summer solstice. Today, gathering at  Stonehenge in the early morning of the winter solstice to watch the sun rise  over the stones is a very popular event. The ancient Romans also marked the winter  solstice with an event called Brumalia (from Latin bruma for \"winter cold\"). This festival was celebrated while the  Romans lived as pagans and worshipped several gods. Once Emperor Justinian  began to suppress paganism, Brumalia was no longer celebrated. Brumalia often started  in late November and lasted for a month. Usually, many animals were offered as  a sacrifice to Saturn, the supreme god, and Ceres, the goddess of agriculture  and fertility. After those rituals, people drank and ate all night.Nowadays, many nations still preserve some of the traditions related to the winter solstice.  People in China traditionally say that the  winter solstice is more important than the New Year's Eve. This saying comes  from Chinese farmers and fishermen who prepared food supplies for the cold  months ahead. In Chinese philosophy, too, the winter solstice is significant,  representing balance and harmony in life by allowing days and nights to come  closer in length. For many years, the Dongzi Festival has been organized to  celebrate the winter solstice. In Chinese, Dongzi means \"the extreme of winter\". There are several customs attached to this  festival. The most important of all is that the family gets together. In  southern China, people leave work early and share delicious rice balls called tang yuan with their family members.  Often brightly colored, tang yuan symbolize reunion. In the North, people  follow a custom started by the Han royal family and eat dumplings. The  old Persian festival called Yalda Night (Shab-e Yalda) has been celebrated in  Iran and several neighboring countries on the night of the winter solstice.  This celebration is also known as Shab-e Chelleh, meaning the \"night of forty\",  as it is also the beginning of a forty-day long period of winter before another  major holiday. Since this is the longest and darkest night of the year, Persian  people believed the evil forces were at their peak, so they started getting  together and staying awake all night to protect themselves. To acknowledge the  winter solstice today, friends and family come together to eat, drink and,  frequently, read poetry, too. Usually, people serve fruits and nuts to their  guests. Pomegranates and watermelons are especially important because their red  color symbolizes the glow of life.\n",

      "See Interesting Word Origins in the English Language, Part 1Learning the origin of every new word you acquire is the best way to really understand how the language works, and to ease the future process of learning. More precisely, multiple words in English often take the same Latin or Greek prefix (letters at the beginning of a word, like pre-, meaning \"before\") or the same suffix (what comes at the end of a word, like –less, meaning \"without\"), so by knowing what they are and where they come from, you can better understand many new words at once. As a verb, \"check\" means to take a close  look at something, or verify it. The word appeared in the 1300s and was used to  describe a call which notes that a move placed the opponent's king in danger in  the popular game of chess. As such, it came from Old French eschequier, meaning \"a check at chess\",  and eschec which is how the French  call chess. However, few people know this French word, too, was borrowed, and  that it was inspired by the Persian word shah meaning \"king\". Initially, the English word \"check\" was used only to describe a harmful  incident or some danger, but it later came to mean \"examining something to see if it is good enough, safe or correct\", slowly becoming one of the most commonly used verbs in English.Tattoos are drawings on a person's body  made by inserting ink or dyes, and can be either temporary or indelible (permanent). Tattoo  is also one of the few words which the English language borrowed from  Polynesian. Polynesian is the language of the people  of Polynesia. Polynesia is a  group of over one thousand islands in the central and southern Pacific Ocean. The name comes from Greek poly (many) + nesos (island).The word tatau in  Polynesian means \"to write\". The first reference to the word \"tattoo\" was found  in the journal of Joseph Banks, a British explorer working on Captain Cook's  ship (Captain Cook was a British  explorer who sailed and mapped much of the South Pacific). When Cook came back to England from Tahiti (an island in Polynesia) in 1769, he spoke about tattaw native people had on their bodies. (Nearly everyone in ancient Polynesian society was tattooed.)Before this word entered the dictionary, English-speaking people described this  concept as painting or staining.\n",
      "The word \"disaster\", used to describe a serious  disruption or an event with grave consequences, traveled a long way to the  English language. The word \"disaster\", used to describe a serious  disruption or an event with grave consequences, traveled a long way to the  English language. It is closely tied to the French désastre, which  itself has roots in Old Italian disastro, but the Italians adopted this word from Greek.  The prefix dis- together with aster,  meaning \"star\" in Greek, can be interpreted as \"a bad star\". The explanation  for why a bad star equals disaster is found in the ancient Greek's fascination  with astronomy and the universe. Therefore, for them, an unfavorable alignment  of planets and stars in the sky was seen as particularly dangerous.The way these unique black and white birds  got their name is still contested. It is possible that the word \"penguin\"  originates from the Welsh language, in which pen means \"head\" and gwyn means \"white\". There are written records which show that an expedition, which  sailed around the world from 1577 to 1580, found these birds at the tip of  South America. The Welsh men on the ship called them \"pengwins\". Some people  also suggest that it might have come from Latin pinguis, which means \"fat\". Considering the cold climate penguins live in, being fat sure serves them well, as the layers of fat protect them from  the cold and also serve as a valuable energy store.  Nowadays, salary is money received  for work, usually  weekly or monthly. The word itself comes from the  Latin word salarium, which actually  means \"payment for salt\". In ancient times, salt was so valuable, it was  referred to as \"white gold\". Salt was not only used for food, but also to treat  wounds, which is why sal, meaning \"salt\",  and salud/salute, meaning \"health\" (in Spanish/Italian),  are so similar. In the ancient Egyptian kingdom, workers were often paid with  salt, which they used to preserve their food.See Interesting Word Origins in the English Language, Part 1\n",

Sandwiches are  such popular snacks that the English word \"sandwich\" is used all over the  world. Not many people know that this snack got its name more than 250 years  ago from John Montagu, who was the 4th Earl of Sandwich. Back in the  18h century, this aristocrat asked his valet (personal servant) to bring him beef served between  two slices of bread. This particular method of serving beef became the Earl's  favorite meal to eat while playing cards, because his hands would not get  greasy from the meat. Soon after, the Earl's  friends began to order \"the same as Sandwich\" when they came to visit, and the  method of putting anything – bread, cheese or vegetables – between two slices of  bread became known as a \"sandwich\".  As the  English language changed over the years, many foreign words and expressions  were adopted. One such word is \"clue\", which in fact derives from a Greek word  \"clew\", which means \"a ball of yarn\" (thread  used for knitting, making cloth, etc.). What is more  interesting is that the particular Greek word was actually motivated by Greek  mythology. Namely, according to the story of Minotaur (part man, part bull),  Ariadne gave Theseus a ball of yarn to help him find his way out of the  Minotaur's labyrinth. Because of this, people started using the word \"clew\" to  describe something that points the way, like when a detective works on solving  a crime.  Ancient Rome  also had some impact on how the English language developed. The word \"palace\"  has its origins from the Rome's famous Palatine, or the Seven Hills, where the  Emperor stayed. His residence eventually grew to be a sprawling (existing over a large area) and rich home,  so the word \"palatine\" became associated with the residence of emperors, and  not the hill. This word reached Britain through  Old French, in which the  word \"palais\" actually referred to the Palatine Hill. Over the years, this word  was modified to \"palace\", but its original form is still visible in the word  \"palatial\", meaning something that is palace-like in terms of its size.   The word  \"awkward\", which is one of the most commonly used adjectives today to describe  something strange, came to Britain from the Vikings, people from Scandinavian  countries in the North. The etymology of the word suggests that the word can be  split into two parts: awk- and –ward. Awk, or afugr, means \"turned the wrong way\" in Old Norse. The –ward suffix  comes from the Old English –weard,  which means \"turned toward\", and this word actually has Germanic origin. Put  together, the word \"awkward\" literally means \"turned towards being turned away  from\". Isn't that awkward?\n"

      "Summer Solstice\n",
      "The longest day of the year is called the  summer solstice. In the Northern Hemisphere, the summer solstice happens on  June 20 or 21, when the sun's path reaches its farthest north position. This  day also marks the beginning of the summer for this part of the world. For  people in the Southern Hemisphere, this happens exactly six months later on or  around December 21, when the sun is in the farthest south. Because the sun's  path is the longest of all, the summer solstice is the day when there is most  daylight and, therefore, the night is the shortest. From this day on, nights  slowly become longer, while days grow shorter for six months until the winter  solstice happens. The word solstice comes from Latin sol, meaning \"sun\", and sistere, meaning \"to stand still\";  however, the summer solstice is also known as \"midsummer\" in many cultures,  because it is considered to be closer to the middle of summer than the  beginning of it. Festivals and holidays relating to the summer solstice started  before Christianity. In ancient times, bonfires were lit on the night of the  summer solstice because it was believed that evil spirits roamed freely as the  sun was turning towards the south.  However, for Christians, this date also marks  the birth of John the Baptist, an early Christian martyr (a person killed for  their religious beliefs). For this reason, midsummer is celebrated as St.  John's Day in a great number of European countries.\n",
      "  For the ancient Romans, the summer  solstice was important as a day devoted to Summanus, the god of nocturnal (of the night) thunder.  On June 20, 278 BC, the temple  of Summanus was dedicated in the city of Rome. The night before the summer  solstice, the Romans used to make wheel-shaped cakes called summanalia, which may have represented the sun. Usually, two dark animals such as black oxen were offered to Summanus as a  sacrifice. This temple was struck by lightning in 197 BC.  Iran's midsummer festival Tirgan dates  back to the ancient times. Initially, Tirgan was dedicated to Tir (or Tishtar),  the god of rain. Celebrated on the day of the summer solstice, this festival gave  Iranians an opportunity to pray to this god for a year without drought. In  today's Iran, Tigran festival starts in early July, in accordance with the  Iranian calendar. Because it is associated with the god of rain, Tirgan is  celebrated by splashing water. Furthermore, children are given rainbow-colored  bands to tie on their wrists and wear for ten days, after which they throw them  into a stream. Sholezard, a  rice-based dessert flavored with saffron and rose water, is traditionally  served on Tirgan.\n",
      "  The midsummer's eve, which generally falls  on June 21, is popularly celebrated in Northern Europe. It is a national  holiday in Sweden and Finland. In Sweden, this holiday, known as  Midsommarafton (\"Midsummer Eve\" in Swedish), is observed for the entire week, starting on June 19. One of  the traditions specific for this holiday is the gathering of people around a  maypole, a tall wooden pole decorated with flowers, and singing and dancing.  This event has ancient roots, and old Scandinavians probably performed it to  celebrate fertility. The Danish equivalent of this holiday is called Sankt Hans  Aften (St. John's Eve). In this country, the midsummer's eve is celebrated with traditional  foods such as smoked or pickled fish and strawberries. To honor their ancient  roots, people also often light a bonfire and sing around it.In  present-day Wales, there are two holidays associated with St John. St John's Night of Midsummer (Gwyl Ifan Ganol Haf in Welsh) is celebrated on the night of the summer solstice. Another similar holiday happens on the night of the winter  solstice and is called St John's Night of Midwinter (Gwyl Ifan Ganol Gaeaf in Welsh). Yet, these Welsh traditions goes back to the pagan Celtic people who marked the  midpoint of summer by lighting huge bonfires to protect themselves against the  evil spirits and jumping over the flame, hoping the highest jump would mark the  height of that year's corn. These kinds of celebrations were noted all over  Britain. More traditionally in Wales agricultural fairs were held on this day, with  much dancing and drinking. In the past several decades, a great folk dancing  festival called Gwyl Ifan is organized in the capital city of Cardiff. The  festival welcomes folk dancers from all around the world, who jointly celebrate  midsummer. \n"
