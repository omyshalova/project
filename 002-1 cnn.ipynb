      "1 Divisive policies and actions from Trump-era that Biden could decide to alter\n",
      "http://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_7c0502232e815f966c19e53fe989790a\n",
      "(CNN) - President Joe Biden assumed the office intent on healing a deeply fractured country and reversing former President Donald Trump's divisive legacy.   \"A cry for survival comes from the planet itself. A cry that can't be any more desperate or any more clear, and now arise political extremism, White supremacy, domestic terrorism that we must confront and we will defeat,\" Biden said during his inaugural speech on Wednesday. For the past four years, the Trump administration embraced policies and initiatives targeting immigrants and undermining the nation's progress on civil rights. All while the President's own words incited violence and bigotry.   Contrary to his predecessor's anti-immigration rhetoric, Biden unveiled a comprehensive plan right away that included a multi-year pathway to citizenship for the millions of undocumented immigrants currently in the United States. On his first day in office, nine of the 17 actions he took directly reverse Trump's policies. Here's a look at some of the Trump-era policies and actions involving immigration, equality and bigotry that Biden is planning to tackle or that he could decide to alter:   The assault on immigration Immigrant family separations: The Trump administration announced on April 6, 2017, a \"zero tolerance\" policy of prosecuting all immigrants who illegally cross the border. It led to the separation of thousands of families, including those with infants, some only a few months old, because children can't be kept in federal jail with their parents. It sparked protests in the streets and eventually prompted a rare reversal from the President himself. The policy ended in 2018 but officials are still scrambling to fix the problems it caused. Last year, lawyers said they haven't been able to reach the parents of 545 children from separated families -- and that hundreds of those parents were likely deported without their children. One of Biden's executive actions undoes Trump's expansion of immigration enforcement within the US. \"Remain in Mexico\" policy and the border wall: Migrants have faced insurmountable challenges to claiming asylum and have been required to stay in Mexico in deplorable conditions, waiting for immigration hearings in the US under the Trump administration's so-called \"remain in Mexico\" policy. The policy, officially known as Migrant Protection Protocols, was implemented in 2019 amid an increase in migrant arrivals at the southern border, with officials arguing that it would deter migrants from making the journey north. Nearly 55,000 migrants, many of whom are from Central America, have been sent back to Mexico, where they have been left to wait for weeks, if not months, in regions deemed dangerous by the US State Department.  In another effort to seal the US off from immigrants and refugees, the Trump administration spent billions on building a border wall.  The Trump administration took a series of steps to erect additional barriers along the southern border, including declaring a national emergency to access additional funds, filing dozens of lawsuits to acquire private land, and waiving environmental and contracting laws to expedite construction. On Wednesday, Biden's order halted the construction of the border wall by terminating the national emergency declaration used to fund it. Trump sought to cancel DACA:  The Obama-era program shielding undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children from deportation was under legal and political siege. The Trump administration tried ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program in 2017 but the US Supreme Court blocked its attempt last summer.  A federal judge ordered authorities to fully restore the program in December, allowing newly eligible immigrants to file new applications.  Trump also spent years limiting the number of refugees coming into the country. For the current fiscal year, his administration set the lowest cap the US has seen in decades. Citing the pandemic, the Trump administration enacted what critics described as unnecessary immigration restrictions, including new rules for international students, and blocked thousands of guest worker visas. During his first day in office, Biden fortified DACA. Travel ban on predominantly Muslim countries: In one of his first moves in office, Trump signed the first travel ban, which caused chaos at airports and eventually landed at the Supreme Court. The policy has been derided by critics as an attempt to ban Muslims from the US. In 2018, the Supreme Court upheld the third version of the travel ban after the previous iterations were challenged in court. The current policy restricts entry from 13 countries to varying degrees, including Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen, along with Venezuela and North Korea.  The administration has argued that the travel ban was vital for national security and ensures countries meet US security needs, by requiring a certain level of identity management and information-sharing requirements. On Wednesday, Biden reversed the Trump administration's restrictions on passport holders from seven Muslim-majority countries. Pushback against racial justice advocacy  Trump blasted NFL players protesting: Athletes took a knee, raised a fist or didn't take to the field while the National Anthem was played before games across the country to draw attention to systematic bias against people of color. Their actions infuriated Trump. He railed against the players, saying they were outraged about \"something that most of them are unable to define\" and reiterated his belief that players who don't stand for the National Anthem should be penalized. The protests began in 2016 when Colin Kaepernick, then a quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers, sat and then knelt before several preseason and regular-season games. He said he did so to protest police shootings of African American men and other social injustices faced by Black people in the United States. Last year, Trump called the \"Black Lives Matter\" movement a \"symbol of hate\" and described people demonstrating for racial justice as \"thugs.\" Department of Justice all but abandoned broad police investigations: Former Justice Department lawyers told CNN the wide-ranging investigations and consent decrees that had defined the Obama administration's approach to police misconduct all but disappeared under Trump. Former US Attorney Jeff Sessions spoke against consent decrees and police investigations, arguing that the cases can lower police morale.  Before Sessions left the department in November 2018, he put in place a memo that required consent agreements to be \"narrowly tailored\" to the injuries caused by misconduct and limited the use of court monitors, among other stipulations. Trump banned anti-discrimination workplace training: Federal agencies were directed to identify and cancel contracts and agency spending related to training programs that suggest the US \"is an inherently racist or evil country\" or \"that any race or ethnicity is inherently racist or evil.\" Trump consistently sided against efforts to reckon with America's fraught racial past and claimed some of those efforts amount to an erasure of history.  A rule meant to combat housing segregation: The Trump administration ended the Obama-era rule known as Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing in 2020.  The rule was enacted in 2015 as a way to bolster the 1968 Fair Housing Act, which outlawed restrictions on selling or renting homes to people based on race. In 1973, Trump and his father were accused in a federal civil rights case of violating those restrictions. The case was eventually settled after Trump attempted to counter-sue. Despite the Fair Housing Act being in effect for decades, many neighborhoods remained segregated, with communities of color less likely to have access to good schools, health care and public programs necessary to help citizens rise out of poverty. The Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule was considered essential to further level the playing field for underprivileged populations. Political rhetoric linked to violence   White supremacist rally in Charlottesville: Trump's handling of the 2017 deadly White supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, was widely criticized and seen as dismissive. In a news conference, Trump blamed the violence on both sides of the conflict. He also took days to publicly acknowledge the death of 32-year-old Heather Heyer, who was killed while protesting the White supremacists and neo-Nazis.   The President's top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, considered quitting and the corporate titans who composed his business advisory council stepped down but the controversy appeared to have had few long-term consequences within the White House.  Mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and the Tree of Life synagogue: Many Latinos and immigrants said they were living in fear after a gunman opened fire at a Walmart store in El Paso, Texas, on August 3, 2019, killing 23 people. The shooting was allegedly carried out by a suspect who published a four-page document filled with White supremacist language and racist hatred aimed at immigrants and Latinos, including some phrases Trump had uttered in the past. In a national address days after the shooting, Trump called on the nation to condemn racism and White supremacy. But he stopped short of acknowledging his own divisive and racist rhetoric. A year before, a gunman killed 11 worshipers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, an incident considered the deadliest attack ever on Jews in the US. Federal prosecutors filed hate crime charges against the suspect, who previously claimed Jews were helping transport members of migrant caravans from Central America.  The Trump administration described the group of migrants as a national security threat.  While Trump denounced the Pittsburgh shooting, the massacre widened a national debate over the President's divisive rhetoric. Some people, including a local rabbi, said the President's hateful speech had led to the massacre.   The US Capitol insurrection: Convinced that the presidential election had been stolen, Trump-supporting rioters touted themselves as \"patriots\" and repeatedly chanted \"USA, USA\" while vandalizing the building at the heart of America's democracy on January 6, the day Congress was meeting to finalize Biden's Electoral College victory. Hours before the insurrection, Trump had addressed a crowd of supporters gathered on the Ellipse near the White House, fanning false allegations of voter fraud and telling them to \"fight like hell.\"  \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol. And we're gonna cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women. And we're probably not going to be cheering, so much for some of them, because you'll never take back our country with weakness, you have to show strength and you have to be strong,\" he said. Trump was impeached for a second time because of his role inciting the insurrection.  Biden called for racial justice and unity in America on Wednesday, acknowledging that the nation has been deeply divided by political forces and systemic racism. In his inaugural speech, Biden denounced White supremacy and domestic terrorism and said the nation needs to be repaired and healed. \"To overcome these challenges, to restore the soul and secure the future America requires so much more than words. It requires the most elusive of all things in a democracy: Unity. Unity,\" Biden said, speaking from the same platform that had been stormed by armed insurrectionists two weeks ago. He acknowledged that speaking of unity can sound foolish these days, but the struggles the nation faces are not new. \"I know the forces that divide us are deep and they are real. But I also know our history has been a constant struggle between the American ideal that we all are created equal and the harsh ugly reality of racism, nativism, fear, demonization have long torn us apart,\" he said, before adding that the better angels of the nation have always prevailed. © 2019 Cable News Network.

      "2 Biden's solicitor general will play critical role in early efforts to undo Trump policies\n",
      "http://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_3185c9e9d8335110d3e3a7064cb954b1\n",
      "Washington  (CNN) - President Joe Biden will name a powerhouse lawyer, Elizabeth Prelogar, to serve as acting solicitor general, in an acknowledgment that the office charged with representing the government before the Supreme Court will face an enormous workload both reversing Trump administration legal positions and developing a defense strategy as Biden's executive actions come under inevitable legal challenge.  Under normal circumstances, when an election produces an administration of a different political stripe, the solicitor general plays a key role managing a wave of potential reversals on certain issues. As Biden replaces Donald Trump, however, it could look more like a tsunami.   In the short term, for instance, the solicitor general's office is likely to notify the court of a new position in a blockbuster dispute concerning the future of the Affordable Care Act, defending the law rather than seeking to overturn it -- but also in other cases tied to controversial Trump policies, some of which the Biden administration may attempt to rescind before the Supreme Court can rule on them.  Under the Trump administration, the solicitor general's office was particularly aggressive defending a broad array of Trump's policies in hot button areas such as immigration, religion and abortion, often asking the justices to jump in before an issue had made its way through the lower courts.   Biden has yet to put forward his nominee for the permanent job. The solicitor general is the person who traditionally represents the US government in cases at the Supreme Court and regularly jousts with the justices in their majestic red velvet lined chamber -- or, as with current practice, over the telephone.  In the interim, Prelogar will be in the forefront. She is a veteran of the Office of Solicitor General having served as an assistant in the office and also worked recently as an adviser to former special counsel Robert Mueller during his investigation into Russian interference into the 2016 election.   Prelogar worked as a former clerk to Judge Merrick Garland, Biden's nominee for Attorney General, as well as the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Justice Elena Kagan. Biden has yet to nominate a full-time solicitor general, and once that person is confirmed, she will be the principal deputy.   \"She's a spectacular lawyer with impeccable integrity and is ideal for this role in the Department,\" said Andrew Goldstein, a former top Mueller team prosecutor.  But while moving quickly, the Biden solicitor general's office also must be careful so as not to irritate justices who expect the government to be an honest broker acting in the long-term interests of the United States, not on the particular whim of one president or another. The court treats government lawyers with special solicitude, but in turn, the justices expect a level of consistency even when an election triggers a change of party in the executive branch.   \"The credibility of the office in great measure depends on the idea that judges actually believe that is what you are doing,\" Kagan, who served as President Barack Obama's solicitor general before her eventual elevation to the high court, said in 2018.   Kagan said the office made clear that its mission was supposed to serve the interest of the United States.   \"I think changing positions is a really big deal that people should hesitate a long time over, which is not to say it never happens,\" she allowed. \"It's always a sensitive matter when the Solicitor General has to change positions,\" Elizabeth Wydra, president of the progressive Constitutional Accountability Center said in an interview. \"But Biden's pick will have no choice but to do so in a number of high-profile cases.\"   In the case of the Affordable Care for instance, already there are blue and red states lined up on both sides of the issue. But the Trump administration argued that the individual mandate is unconstitutional and that the entire sprawling law should fall -- leaving the health care of millions in legal limbo.  It may only be a symbolic move that won't change the outcome of the case, but the new solicitor general will likely make clear to the court that the administration believes the signature legislative achievement of Obama's administration is on solid legal ground. The justices heard arguments on November 10.   Because the lawsuit was brought by Texas and other GOP-led states, rather than the Trump administration itself, the Biden Justice Department can change its stance but that wouldn't result in the case becoming moot. Border wall, immigration and health care on the docket  On February 22 the justices are scheduled to hear arguments concerning funding for Trump's border wall. And on March 1 they are scheduled to take on Trump's policy that mandates that non-Mexican asylum seekers stay in Mexico as they await hearings in the United States.   How the Biden administration and court will proceed is an open question. The President on Wednesday ended the national emergency that the Trump administration had used to divert money for the border wall. And it is suspending the program regarding asylum seekers.   The next day the court will consider a case concerning the Voting Rights Act.   Although not scheduled for oral arguments yet the court has also agreed to hear two cases concerning the Trump administration's effort to allow states to impose work requirements in their Medicaid programs.  \"Every cross-party transition raises these kinds of issues, but this one seems different in two respects,\" said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law. \"First, the court has an unusually high number of cases challenging the old administration's policies on its docket this term, raising the specter that a number of those cases go away if and when the new administration rescinds them. Second, the Trump administration has been unusually aggressive in its litigation posture before the Justices -- whereas the Biden administration may be inclined to move slower on high-profile, hot-button cases.\"   Along with cases on the docket, the justices are also currently considering whether to take up additional cases linked to Trump -- some of which might become moot after he is no longer in office. Cases that are currently pending concern Trump's Twitter feed, two cases concerning whether he violated the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, others concerning restrictions that bar family planning clinics that  receive federal funds from making referrals for abortion as well as petitions related to immigration.  And there is an emergency petition arising from Trump's personal lawyers who are asking the court to block the release of his tax returns to a NY prosecutor.   On his first day as president, Biden released several new executive actions and promised more to come. Critics are likely to race to court to try to stop them. \"The Biden administration should take a both/and approach to executive action and legislative priorities,\" Wydra said. \"There is a lot of damage from the Trump administration that can and should be addressed immediately through executive action -- on police reform and immigration issues, for example -- while simultaneously pushing Congress for broader and more permanent legislation,\" she said.   Who's in play for the permanent job The solicitor general position needs Senate confirmation which often takes some time.   If Biden -- perhaps thinking that he might get a Supreme Court appointment in the near term, perhaps from a retirement of Justice Stephen Breyer — wants to take a page from the Obama/Kagan playbook he could name someone like California Supreme Court Justice Leondra Kruger so as to prepare her for a potential seat on the high court. But Kruger may not want to leave a good job to face a bitter confirmation battle that might in short order lead to another battle for the high court.   No less than Chief Justice John Roberts once served as a deputy in the office. At his confirmation hearing in 2005 he spoke of the experience.   \"I always found it very moving to stand before the Justices and say, 'I speak for my country,'\" he said.   For legendary Justice Thurgood Marshall, working as solicitor general was the \"best job I've ever had.\"  © 2019 Cable News Network. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

      "http://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_79cf7a797b5a83a31435fc2bb3175f26\n",
      "Washington  (CNN) - The Biden administration will seek a full five-year extension of a key arms control treaty between the US and Russia, according to a US official. The New START Treaty expires in just over two weeks on February 5. CNN previously reported that Biden advisers indicated that the administration would not seek a shorter extension on the landmark deal. President Joe Biden has expressed support for extending the deal with Russia and using it as a foundation to pursue future arms-control arrangements. Secretary of State-designate Antony Blinken said during his confirmation hearing Tuesday that President Joe Biden intended to seek an extension of the treaty, but suggested he had not made a decision on the length of that extension. The secretary of state-designate noted that Biden \"couldn't really engage\" on the issue during the transition because he was \"very cognizant of the fact we have one president at a time.\" Blinken told lawmakers that he believes \"this is something that we will be coming to you on pretty much immediately as soon as the President is sworn-in, and I know that he does intend to seek an extension, and he'll have to make a decision as President about what duration he would seek.\" The Trump administration went back and forth with the Russians on the terms of a shorter extension to the longstanding treaty after efforts to create a new trilateral treaty with Russia and China failed.

      "4 Why Joe Biden is already thinking about a 2nd term\n",
      "http://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_74564c481dd198ef03d924569e617f38\n",
      "(CNN) - Even before Joe Biden became the country's 46th president on Wednesday, his orbit was sending out signals that he wouldn't be a one-term wonder. \"He is planning to run again,\" Delaware Sen. Chris Coons told Politico over the weekend. \"He knows that we are at the middle of an absolute turning point, a pivot point in American history. And he's up for the challenge.\" Which is interesting! After all, Coons is one of Biden's closest allies and advisers. Which means it's pretty unlikely that he just sort of spouted off -- days before Biden became president -- about the 46th president's plans to run again in 2024.  This was, without question, a concerted effort -- and strategy -- to get the word out that Biden has no plans to limit himself to a single term. And it's a very smart strategy. Why? Because the second that Biden -- or one of his top surrogates -- suggests that Biden, who, at 78, is by far the oldest person ever sworn in for a first presidential term, may not run again, he immediately becomes a lame duck. The clock starts ticking on the end of his term and Republicans begin the process of stalling as much as possible -- knowing that Biden is going to be gone in less than four years. (There's a reason that the last president to make a one-term limit pledge was Rutherford B. Hayes way back in the 1870s.) It's also suggests there's been a significant change from where Biden reportedly was on seeking second term -- at age 82 -- as recently as December 2019. As Politico's Ryan Lizza reported at the time: \"Former Vice President Joe Biden's top advisers and prominent Democrats outside the Biden campaign have recently revived a long-running debate whether Biden should publicly pledge to serve only one term, with Biden himself signaling to aides that he would serve only a single term. \"While the option of making a public pledge remains available, Biden has for now settled on an alternative strategy: quietly indicating that he will almost certainly not run for a second term while declining to make a promise that he and his advisers fear could turn him into a lame duck and sap him of his political capital.\" And Biden spoke openly about his candidacy (and presidency) as a sort of generational bridge for the party and the country. \"Look, I view myself as a bridge, not as anything else,\" Biden said in March 2020. \"There's an entire generation of leaders you saw stand behind me. They are the future of this country.\" But by August, with Donald Trump ramping up attacks on the former vice president's age and ability to do the job of president, Biden was less vague about his future plans, Asked whether he could see himself running again in four years, he responded: \"Absolutely.\" The truth is that no one -- Biden included -- knows what he and the country will look like in four years' time. Did anyone think that 18 months ago that we would be in the grips of a global pandemic that has already killed more than 400,000 Americans? Exactly. But words have impact. And Coons' pledge that Biden not only could run again but it is \"planning\" to do so is very clearly meant to send a signal to every Democratic and Republican in Washington that this guy isn't going anywhere -- so it's time to get to work with him on the problems facing the country. © 2019 Cable News Network.

He is the author of \"Pitch Perfect: How to Say It Right the First Time, Every Time.\" Follow him on Twitter @BillMcGowan22. Juliana Silva is a strategic communications adviser at Clarity. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authors. View more opinion articles on CNN. (CNN) - \"When day comes, we ask ourselves, where can we find light in this never-ending shade?\"     This was the opening line of the captivating inaugural poem delivered by 22-year-old poet laureate Amanda Gorman. Her electric presence and poetic eloquence served to set the optical lens through which we would see Joe Biden's inauguration: light triumphing over dark.   The dark and divisively opposing forces of the past couple of months were always hellbent on raining on Joe Biden's parade. But perhaps in a sign of the outgoing President's quickly diminishing influence, gentle snowflakes performed a graceful dance to Earth on cue, just as incoming President Biden was about to make his appearance on the inaugural stage. Then, the sun broke out and beamed brightly over the first few bars of the national anthem.   A mere mask could not conceal Vice President Kamala Harris' beaming smile. Her glistening eyes told the whole story. In fact, every dignitary on stage displayed the kind of joyful celebration normally reserved for greeting returning war soldiers.   By contrast, Donald Trump's inauguration speech four years ago was a dreary and dismal affair, laced with rhetoric of \"American carnage.\"  No wonder that a Council on Foreign Relations policy expert deemed it one of the two worst inauguration speeches of all time (the other being James Buchanan's, which blamed the country's persisting problems on the distraction of the slavery debate.)  At Biden's swearing in, the reassuring theme of light and hope took center stage. What he needed to execute was an oratory high-wire act, balancing the stark reality of the \"cascade of crises\" he said we simultaneously face with the call to write an American story of hope and decency.    It was an oratorical high point for Biden. He used the full range of his voice to underscore both the enormity of today's challenges and his unwavering belief in the promise of tomorrow. At moments when he was seeking to build confidence and optimism among Americans that brighter days lie ahead, his voice projection dipped lower to create an intimate yet intense heartfelt reassurance. In referencing the January 6 rioters, he declared that stopping the will of our democracy \"will never happen. Not today, not tomorrow, not ever,\" his voice swelling louder with determination and conviction.   The speech captured the spirit of many presidential calls for unity and healing that preceded it. It drew from Abraham Lincoln, whose reference to the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 read, \"If my name ever goes down in history, it will be for this act, and my whole soul is in it.\" Biden's standout line about uniting the country was, \"My whole soul is in this.\"  It was one part Franklin D. Roosevelt, transforming \"the only thing we have to fear, is fear itself,\" into \"together, we shall write an American story of hope, not fear.\"  It also tapped into the iconic John F. Kennedy line, \"ask not what your country can do for you -- ask what you can do for your country,\"  when the President quoted from one of his favorite songs, \"American Anthem\": \"When my days are through, America, America, I gave my best to you.\"   The speech was the kind of enormous olive branch to adversaries that only Joe Biden could wield with any degree of sincerity. It was his call to disarm: \"We must end this uncivil war.\"    But perhaps the most dramatic optic was the backdrop, the Capitol itself. On Inauguration Day, it was replete with all the majesty and splendor customary of every inaugural that has preceded it. Looking at the pomp and ceremony amidst all the patriotic bunting, it was hard to reconcile that just two weeks earlier, an angry, insurrectionist mob had smashed windows and desecrated the very cradle of American democracy. The fact that there were no visual remnants of that horrific episode helped reinforce democracy's resilience and the prospect that the soul of the country, what Joe Biden has said many times that he was fighting for, could be reborn.   What perfectly augmented Biden's message of light triumphing over darkness was the way the ceremonies and its setting were bathed in the sun's radiance. If Americans are to have faith that the country can successfully unite during a time of multiple crises and divisiveness, then the optimistic optics of the day got things off to a good start. © 2019 Cable News Network.

      "6 Evidence shows Capitol rioters brutally attacked police with flagpoles, fire extinguishers and fists\n",
      "http://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_73374766dcaea8c8cbd03fc18e5911d9\n",
      "Washington  (CNN) - The unprecedented images spoke for themselves, but as prosecutors start filing criminal charges against pro-Trump rioters who attacked the US Capitol, new evidence is emerging of the horrifying scenes police officers faced while fighting for their lives that day.  Body camera footage from DC police, testimony from law enforcement officers and social media posts from rioters all chronicled in federal court documents are painting a fuller picture of the hand-to-hand combat between law enforcement and supporters of former President Donald Trump during the violent insurrection that he incited on January 6.  Officers were beaten with whatever the rioters had with them, according to court documents, including an American flag and a fire extinguisher. Scuffles near broken glass led to scrapes and bruises. Some rioters threw punches, while others hurled verbal insults at police.  One US Capitol Police officer, Brian Sicknick, was killed during the melee. More than 100 other police officers were injured, including members of the Capitol Police and Washington DC's Metropolitan Police Department. At least 15 officers were hospitalized after the insurrection.  Violent attacks Federal prosecutors have already charged dozens of people who allegedly participated in the riot, but the most serious charges have come against people involved in attacks against police. And the hundreds of pages of newly unsealed court documents are telling a horrifying story.  One Texas resident who is facing charges allegedly incited the crowd before entering the Capitol through a broken window. He shouted into a bullhorn, \"If you have a weapon, you need to get your weapon,\" and \"this is not a peaceful protest,\" according to court documents.  Prosecutors say a retired Pennsylvania firefighter, Robert Sanford, 55, threw a fire extinguisher at a group of police officers on the Capitol's western terrace. The fire extinguisher struck three officers in the head, including one who was later went to the hospital for medical evaluation.  Sanford's lawyer did not respond to request for comment. He told the Associated Press that his client got \"caught up in the mob mentality.\" In another incident, Arkansas resident Peter Stager battered a DC officer with a flagpole that was holding an American flag, according to prosecutors. Court documents described a harrowing scene where the officer was dragged on the ground and surrounded by rioters.  Stager told an FBI tipster that he thought he was attacking a member of the violent left-wing group Antifa, even though photos from the scene clearly show the officer wearing a police vest. A lawyer for Stager did not respond to a request for comment. Separately, another group of attackers surrounded one DC police officer and repeatedly tasered him in the neck, causing a heart attack. The officer, Michael Fanone, previously recalled to CNN that he begged the rioters to spare his life. \"I just remember yelling out that I have kids,\" he said.  CNN previously reported that many US Capitol Police officers felt betrayed by their leadership, with officers left in previous positions throughout the attack, woefully unprepared and vastly outnumbered by the pro-Trump mob. Officers told CNN that they heard colleagues pleading for help, both for specific emergencies unfolding and for a big-picture plan to re-take the Capitol.   Hand-to-hand combat  Some participants in the riot were armed with bear spray and other weapons. Others simply meandered around the building and gawked at statues. But for the first time since the War of 1812, federal forces inside the Capitol found themselves engaged in hand-to-hand combat.  One defendant, Mark Leffingwell of Seattle, was allegedly involved in a fistfight with police.  \"Leffingwell attempted to push past me and other officers,\" US Capitol Police Officer Daniel Amendola wrote in a sworn affidavit one day after the insurrection. \"When he was deterred from advancing further into the building, Leffingwell punched me repeatedly with a closed fist.\"  A lawyer for Leffingwell did not respond to a request for comment. Some scuffles got out of hand. While one officer tried to block rioters from entering the Capitol through a broken window, he fell to the ground, which was \"covered in shaards of glass,\" according to charging documents against a father and son that came to DC from Delaware.  Another rioter warned police inside the Capitol that they should stand down if they didn't want to get hurt by the mob of Trump supporters that was approaching, according to court papers. Bodycam footage included in one criminal complaint showed the perspective of the police officers who were swarmed by dozens of rioters. According to the court documents, some of the rioters chanted \"f--- the police,\" even though many carried \"thin blue line\" flags, which are associated with groups that typically argue that law enforcement is unfairly attacked by liberals.  One Black police officer previously told CNN that \"there was a lot of racism\" coming from the pro-Trump rioters, and that he was called racial slurs and epithets by some of the attackers © 2019 Cable News Network.

      "7 Army now acknowledges the brother of Michael Flynn was a part of Army response to Capitol riot\n",
      "http://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_99aaea3838e01826a23521a021081cbc\n",
      "Washington  (CNN) - The Army is now acknowledging that Lt. Gen. Charles Flynn, the brother of President Donald Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn, was in the room for one of the key January 6 phone calls in which DC government and US Capitol Police were asking for National Guard troops to quell the unfolding violence at the US Capitol. The decision-making has come under scrutiny as city and Capitol Police officials have alleged that the Pentagon was slow to respond, while the Pentagon and Army maintain they never denied or delayed requests for the National Guard.  In official timelines released by the Department of Defense in the wake of the riot, Charles Flynn, the deputy chief of staff of the Army, was not listed as participating in any of the calls that day about mobilizing the National Guard to respond to the riot. The Washington Post was the first to report Flynn's participation in the call. \"I entered the room after the call began and departed prior to the call ending, as I believed a decision was imminent from (then-Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy) and I needed to be in my office to assist in executing the decision,\" Flynn said in a statement released to CNN. There was no clear answer about how long Flynn was on the call or whether he contributed to the conversation. The Washington Post reports that the Army \"falsely denied for days that Lt. Gen. Charles A. Flynn\" was involved in the key meetings. One of the officials who was on the call told CNN in the days following the insurrection at the Capitol that Flynn was not on the calls, but the military did not confirm his participation until Wednesday. There is no indication that Charles Flynn agrees with his brother, who was a vocal adherent of disputing President Joe Biden's victory on behalf of the former president. Michael Flynn, who was pardoned by Trump, had suggested in an Oval Office meeting that the President should invoke martial law as part of the effort to overturn the election, though others in the room pushed back on the idea, CNN previously reported. At a rally the day before the riot, Michael Flynn urged the crowd to dispute the election results.  \"Those of you who are feeling weak tonight, those of you that don't have the moral fiber in your body, get some tonight because tomorrow, we the people are going to be here, and we want you to know that we will not stand for a lie,\" he said. The official timeline from the office of then-acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller listed McCarthy, DC Mayor Muriel Bowser, the city's deputy mayor, DC Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency Director Christopher Rodriguez, and Metropolitan Police Department leadership as participants on the call. Gen. Walter Piatt, director of the Army staff, was also on the call.  But there was no mention of the involvement of Charles Flynn, a three-star general who has already been approved by Congress for a fourth star. Flynn is responsible for operations, plans and training, but he is not part of the chain of command of the DC National Guard, and he does not have the authority to deploy troops.  The revelation comes as the Department of Defense is already trying to rebut accusations that it denied or delayed the deployment of additional troops as the riot worsened on Capitol Hill, eventually leaving five dead, including a Capitol Police officer. A DC official called the process of calling up more guardsmen \"long\" and \"tortured.\" Pentagon officials have repeatedly denied the accusations, insisting there were no intentional delays, though McCarthy on Monday told CNN the response was hampered by an \"archaic system.\" In the days leading up to January 6, Pentagon officials were sensitive to the deployment of troops on the streets of DC, particularly after the criticism they faced following the Army's response to June's protests. Nevertheless, the Pentagon deployed 340 members of the DC National Guard, asking both the city and the Capitol Police if they needed more troops. Both said no. But as the situation rapidly deteriorated on January 6, now-ousted Capitol Police Chief Stephen Sund and DC officials say military leaders waffled and were overly concerned about the public perception of more troops being deployed on the streets once again. The open involvement of Charles Flynn, just one day after his brother, Michael Flynn, egged on Trump supports with cries of a stolen election and violent imagery, would have only increased that scrutiny. The elder Flynn was permanently banned from Twitter for promoting QAnon and spreading lies and conspiracy theories about the presidential election. Michael Flynn, who briefly served as Trump's first national security adviser, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with Russian diplomats before Trump pardoned him in November. © 2019 Cable News Network.

      "http://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_58ccbd3d01aff09203ce7396d9a5a616\n",
      "(CNN) - A leader of the Proud Boys, an extremist group that took part in the US Capitol insurrection, was taken into custody and is facing charges, federal officials said. Joseph Randall Biggs, 37, of Florida was arrested Wednesday and is facing three counts -- obstruction of a proceeding, entering restricted grounds and disorderly conduct -- for his part in the siege of the Capitol on January 6, according to the Justice Department and an FBI affidavit. The FBI described Biggs in the affidavit as an organizer for the Proud Boys. Biggs appeared in court in Orlando on Wednesday and was released under home confinement and other restrictions, according to his court file. A lawyer who represented him in court did not respond to a request for comment. CNN Orlando affiliate WESH asked Biggs about insurrection allegations against the Proud Boys and he said, \"That'll be discussed in court.\"  Ahead of the Capitol riot, Biggs posted messages on Parler, the social media platform favored by the far right, telling his followers to blend in and not wear identifiable clothing, an FBI special agent wrote in the affidavit.  \"The only thing we'll do that's us is think like us! Jan 6th is gonna be epic,\" Biggs wrote, according to the affidavit. The document says Biggs was also directing his statements at Antifa.  Authorities say Biggs said, \"This is awesome!\" on livestreamed footage of rioters entering the Capitol building, according to the affidavit. The affidavit states it appears the Proud Boys were wearing earpieces for communication that day.  \"Your affiant also notes that multiple individuals were photographed or depicted on videos with earpieces, including other individuals believed to be associated with the Proud Boys,\" the FBI affidavit says. The charges are among a recent spate of federal cases that allege planning and organization among far-right groups.  The FBI said that Biggs told agents he entered the Capitol but not by using force, and denied knowing about any planning for the storming of the building. Biggs has been a fixture in other mass gatherings involving the Proud Boys. He is known for his extreme rhetoric against Antifa members, the black-clad left-wingers who maintain they are fighting fascism and often crash far-right events. © 2019 Cable News Network.

      "9 Trump's business was crashing even before the Capitol riot made his brand toxic\n",
      "http://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_19402537bd6eb5b56c530258c038db9a\n",
      "London  (CNN Business) - Donald Trump's businesses generated nearly 40% less revenue last year as the coronavirus pandemic slammed the hotel industry, putting the former president under financial pressure even before corporate partners and banks ditched him in the wake of the insurrection at the US Capitol.  Posted on Wednesday as he left the White House, Trump's final financial disclosure as president reveals a steep decline in revenue at some of his marquee properties in 2020 and the first 20 days of this year. Sales at the Trump International Hotel Washington plummeted by 63% compared with 2019 to $15.1 million, while revenue fell 62% to $9.8 million at Scottish golf resort Turnberry.  Revenue at one of the former president's biggest businesses, the Trump National Doral golf resort near Miami, declined to $44.2 million from $77.2 million in 2019. Trump has mortgages on the property totaling between $55 million and $75 million, according to the document. The loans from Deutsche Bank mature in 2023. Federal officials are allowed to disclose their income and the value of their assets in broad ranges. Overall, Trump reported revenue for 2020 of $278 million to $313 million, down from $445 million to $483 million in 2019. Based on the midpoint of those ranges, revenue fell by 37%.  Hotels and other hospitality companies, which form a substantial part of Trump's business empire, have been hit especially hard during the pandemic as travelers stay home and governments impose lockdowns. In Scotland, for example, Trump Turnberry has been forced to close because of government restrictions designed to contain the spread of the coronavirus. There were a few bright spots for the Trump Organization. Revenue was fairly steady at his golf courses in Charlotte, North Carolina, Philadelphia and New York's Hudson Valley. Sales at the Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, where Trump returned after leaving the White House on Wednesday, increased to $24.2 million from $21.4 million. (He transferred his permanent residence to the Florida property from Trump Tower in New York in 2019, and spent hundreds of days golfing at courses he owned during his presidency.) Still, there are major questions about the president's business after his supporters vandalized the Capitol earlier this month in a brazen assault that left five people dead and sparked a major corporate backlash. Twitter and Facebook banned Trump indefinitely, taking away his biggest megaphones. Stripe is no longer processing credit card payments for his campaign organization, Shopify stopped operating online stores for the Trump Organization and the campaign and the PGA announced it was pulling a major golf tournament from his Bedminister, New Jersey, course. New York City is seeking to terminate its business relationships with the Trump Organization. That would prevent Trump from continuing to operate several recreational venues including the Wollman ice skating rink in Central Park, which generated $4.5 million in revenue in 2020, according to the financial disclosure. Deutsche Bank has decided to no longer do business with Trump, a source told CNN Business earlier this month. In addition to the mortgages on the Doral property, Germany's biggest bank has also provided loans for the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago and the company's hotel in Washington. The Trump Organization owes Deutsche Bank approximately $340 million in the coming years, the source said. It's unclear which, if any, other banks will want to loan money to the Trump Organization.  New York state criminal investigators looking into Trump's business practices have subpoenaed the bank about its lending relationship with the Trump Organization. Late last month the two private bankers at Deutsche Bank who worked most closely with Trump resigned their positions.  Signature Bank said following the attack on the Capitol that it had started closing Trump's personal accounts. The former president has a checking account with the bank, according to his financial disclosure. The Trump Organization did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday. — Matt Egan and Chris Isidore contributed reporting. © 2019 Cable News Network.

      "10 Opinion: What motivated the Capitol rioters\n",
      "http://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_c1d71fb1632a730409d2b4cdf3c14088\n",
      "Editor's Note: Heather Tsavaris served at the US Department of State from 2002 to 2012, spending most of that time as a senior terrorism analyst in the Bureau of Intelligence and Research. Subsequently, Heather served in a consulting capacity to the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Community Partnerships and now works to improve community well-being at the local level. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN. (CNN) - As I watched the attack on our nation's Capitol, my heart broke and I was so incredibly angry.  But this isn't about one day of events. When I watched the people storming the Capitol, parroting talking points they have heard ceaselessly on social media feeds for months, their words matched the themes that I repeatedly saw during my 10 years working in counterterrorism at the State Department's Office of Counterterrorism and the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research. I was an all-source analyst, which meant I spent my days reading hundreds of intelligence reports trying to understand how al Qaeda, and eventually ISIS and al-Shabab, planned their attacks and how they recruited, radicalized and retained supporters.  Themes kept emerging. Recruitment messages were ones of strength that landed so well for people who felt they had no power. They offered a way to belong for people who felt like they were perennial outsiders, and they claimed your life may have been insignificant up to this point but, if you are willing to join the cause now, you will have meaning beyond your wildest dreams. The culmination of a very different kind of recruitment messaging that also played on themes of significance is what I saw unfolding at the Capitol, and I am haunted by the images, the words, the livestreams and interviews of people who participated in the insurrection, and probably will be forever. The sentiment that I heard repeated often from the rioters was that the President invited them there and told them to storm the Capitol. I saw videos of men who looked like the guys I grew up with in my small mid-Western hometown, who would be far more at ease at a Friday night high school football game than part of a group violently beating down the doors of our nation's hallowed Capitol. I heard young adults with wonderment in their voices, seemingly in disbelief that they made it inside of the Capitol. There were also the people excitedly telling one another, you have to tell your grandkids about this. After the Capitol was secured and so many of us continued to reel in shock, livestream footage from the lobby of the Grand Hyatt had a different feel.  There was a palpable sense of community, connection, and belonging amongst those who had traveled to be part of a historic day. These people had come to be together with others who were like them. They chatted about where they had flown in from, how they were thrilled to be meeting other \"patriots,\" what this event meant to them -- mere hours after so much destruction and death had just occurred. One irony for me was that the last time I was in that Grand Hyatt lobby, I was receiving training from the US Department of Homeland Security on countering violent extremism.  To be clear, while I noticed striking similarities between the messaging themes like purpose, significance, and belonging that influenced the Capitol rioters and how people are recruited to join terrorist organizations, there were differences. One main one that I saw: Terrorist groups aim to harm civilians, but the rioters intended to disrupt a cornerstone of US democracy and, for a few at least, harm elected officials because they believe unsubstantiated claims about their votes were not being counted.  From a former terrorism analyst, who now works to improve community well-being, I know what it looks like when those ravenous for power manipulate people who feel they -- and their beliefs -- have been cast aside. Until we deeply understand and address how every human needs purpose, meaning, belonging and ways to contribute, there will always be selfish people claiming to fulfill these most basic needs towards their own narrow purposes, resulting in dire and sometimes deadly consequences.  As I, and so many others ponder what to do next, I can't help but think about how the US government has tried for years to address violent extremism: more stringent social media terms of use, improved community awareness, deployment of credible voices pushing back against extremist messages. All of these tactics have a place. We are talking about a different situation here, though. A powerful tool in this instance is deeper community engagement that seeks to humanize, connect with, and profoundly understand the needs of our neighbors, including those who went to the Capitol. Some were intent to carry out violence, did so, and should be condemned and fully prosecuted. But it would be useful to understand how, in the propagating of violence, they found such clear purpose and meaning, and intense belonging. Importantly, there are scores more who would never consider violence but who feel exceedingly marginalized who also must be heard -- frankly, on this issue and on so many more.  Although I no longer work in counterterrorism, my work is still very much focused on promoting belonging, purpose, meaning and ways to contribute in order to strengthen our local community.  To do this, I have led work in partnership with incarcerated men and those recently returned home to understand and create solutions together that improve their own sense of belonging when they are released. In so doing, community power brokers have said to them -- we need your help, your expertise. We can't do this without you. I have engaged with formerly homeless young people to leverage their expertise and ideas about how to support youth experiencing homelessness during Covid. I have witnessed these young people step into their power when they presented their work to city councils. Realizing that they are making history in their community. That these are the stories they will tell their grandkids. The goal of this work is to listen without judgment, unearth new insights, and create solutions together that offer true belonging and well-being for us all. Maybe this is the kind of approach that could provide more belonging for more people in a nation that really seems to need it. © 2019 Cable News Network. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.

      "11 The huge stakes of Biden's new Covid-19 plan\n",
      "http://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_383bb2f3b5ca383a439aa640720b4da5\n",
      "(CNN) - President Joe Biden is so far as good as his word to \"manage the hell\" out of the pandemic, driven by urgency to revive a sickened, struggling nation and the certainty that his entire presidency rests on eradicating Covid-19. Until now, it's been easy for the new President to criticize the Trump administration's obviously negligent and incompetent response to the worst public health crisis in 100 years. But words are no longer enough now that he's behind the Oval Office desk with Americans dreaming of a vaccine and a return to work, family life and travel. Reflecting this pressure, Biden appeared on camera on Thursday, signing a slew of executive orders that showed him in the act of wielding his new power to combat the virus. Seizing the power of the presidency to galvanize action, he issued a detailed new anti-pandemic strategy, pledged a genuine \"wartime\" effort to expand vaccine distribution, supplies and testing. He mandated masks on federal lands and in inter-state train, bus and air travel. Biden plans new vaccination sites across the country and to activate pharmacies in every neighborhood. There is a strong impression that after four years of chaos and incompetence at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, serious people are now in charge. This administration appears better stocked in expertise, respect for science, organizational skills and experience than the previous one. And there is a President who is now empowering his team rather than trashing its message. In a break with the lies, spin and boastful nonsense of the previous White House's briefings, Biden sent Dr. Anthony Fauci out to share science and truth with no fear of presidential reprisals.  \"The idea that you can get up here and talk about what you know, what the evidence, what the science is — let the science speak, it is somewhat of a liberating feeling,\" said the government's top infectious diseases expert, who often clashed with former President Donald Trump's fantastical alternative realities.  Fauci -- who was sidelined by Trump, who spouted uniformed, politicized misinformation in coronavirus task force briefings -- said things were already far more professional. \"You know, one of the new things in this administration is if you don't know the answer, don't guess,\" he said. What is so striking is that Biden's approach, while welcome, is in many cases implementing measures that a comprehensive pandemic response from the previous administration would have taken at the start. It is rooted in a bet that throwing federal government expertise, money and scale at a crisis can turn the situation around and finally provide the leadership and coordination that has been lacking in the year since the coronavirus struck the US. Ending the threat from the virus would in turn be the best path to easing the economic disaster after another 900,000 people filed first-time unemployment claims last week, building new pressure on Congress to quickly approve Biden's $1.9 trillion rescue plan despite Republican concern over its cost. The President will turn from the epidemiological challenge of the virus on Friday to the economic consequences of the pandemic as he signs another set of executive orders to bring relief after an intense start to his term. The pandemic's new political equation  There are two concurrent tracks in the ramped up coronavirus response: the rush to intensify the battle against the virus and the political effort to manage the fallout from the crisis and its impact on the early months of the new presidency. Thus, the President is adopting a two-pronged message — warning that the season of death and sickness will intensify, while offering an optimistic prediction that the horror will not last forever. \"Things are going to continue to get worse before they get better ... The death toll will likely top 500,000 next month and the cases will continue to mount,\" Biden said as he unveiled his new strategy at the White House. \"We didn't get into this mess overnight. It's going to take months for us to turn things around. And let me be equally clear, we will get through this. We will defeat this pandemic.\" But it is one thing to come up with a strategy. It's another thing for Biden, and his incoming team of high-ranking scientists, medical experts and logistics experts, to quickly turn around often sluggish federal government machinery. The White House will need states, some of which have failed badly in all aspects of the pandemic, to respond to the new federal effort. And while Biden can change policy with his pen, he needs massive, swift investment from a tightly balanced Congress to make his plan work. Then there are the medical factors beyond his control. While hospitalizations are declining in a sign of hope, many experts fear that it could be a temporary relief and new, more transmissible versions of the virus will quash hopes of a significant easing of the situation in the spring. And even in countries where the pandemic has been better handled, there have been a string of busted timelines over when normal life might resume, as coronavirus defies attempts to eradicate it from societies. So there is a question of how much more patience the American people have, with no clear answers yet from the government on when individuals not in the highest risk age and medical categories can get vaccinated.  While the Biden administration is just getting started, the country has been locked in the purgatory of lockdowns, working and schooling from home, amid separation from family members for 10 months. Trump's attacks on the legitimacy of Biden's election win, meanwhile, may challenge the authority of his new measures and the willingness of millions of Americans to listen. Blaming Trump  Sources told CNN earlier that the Trump administration, which disrupted the transition to the new White House, left no national vaccine plan and that the new administration was effectively starting from scratch. While that rings true given the previous administration's failure to meet its goal of 20 million people vaccinated by the end of 2020, Fauci on Thursday was less equivocal on this score, saying, \"We're certainly not starting from scratch, because there is activity going on in the distribution.\" In any case, announcing that they were starting from square one also appeared to be an effort to manage expectations for Biden and to give his team some time to crank up the new anti-Covid offensive with the virus still spreading out of control. While the new President's promise to administer 100 million doses of the vaccine in his first 100 days would represent a significant improvement, it pales against the magnitude of the problem. Since two vaccines currently authorized for emergency use in the US require two doses, the plan means that less than a sixth of all Americans would be vaccinated by the end of April. Unless vaccine supply can be significantly ramped up — through Biden's more aggressive use of the Defense Production Act, for example — it could be many months before all Americans are inoculated.  The new President betrayed the high stakes of the pandemic response operation at the end of his event at the White House Thursday when asked whether he was setting the bar high enough. \"When I announced it, you all said it's not possible. Come on, give me a break, man,\" the President said, betraying a tetchiness with second guessing from the press likely to become more pronounced as his honeymoon period fades. Still, many experts are confident that with a concentrated effort, the new administration will be successful in cranking up both the supply and the distribution of the vaccine.  It was notable, for instance, that Fauci, in common with other experts, appeared to indicate that the bigger concern in the long term was whether sufficient Americans would take the vaccine to assure herd immunity — the point at which enough people have been infected with Covid-19 or immunized against it to stop transmission of the virus. \"If we get 70% to 85% of the country vaccinated, let's say by the end of the summer, middle of the summer, I believe by the time we get to the fall, we will be approaching a degree of normality,\" Fauci said. If he's right, the American people will get their lives back and Biden can expect a serious payoff of public trust, political capital and a reputation for competence that would be invaluable in building support for his ambitious legislative agenda, and ultimately his place in history. © 2019 Cable News Network.

      "12 Experts say Biden's vaccine strategy could benefit from good timing\n",
      "http://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_87b98d66dc53566f1a468d62dd9fe4e4\n",
      "(CNN) - As President Joe Biden takes steps to try to ramp up vaccine production, experts say the biggest boon to his administration's vaccine strategy could simply be good timing.   The President on Thursday directed federal agencies to use \"all available legal authorities, including the Defense Production Act\" to boost vaccine supply, but experts tell CNN that Biden's team may be positioned for success even if it does relatively little, as the administration absorbs a flawed vaccine-distribution effort but at the same moment manufacturers hit a stride and states work out the kinks in their own distribution plans.   \"They're going to take advantage of the learning curve,\" said Vijay Samant, a former Merck executive who oversaw the production of three successful vaccines during his tenure. Samant said vaccine manufacturers have had months to work out supply bottlenecks and that manufacturing was always projected to speed up in the coming months -- a boon for the Biden administration. \"They may get a lot of credit because all of a sudden vaccine doses are going to become available and it's, 'Oh, well, we did it,' \" Samant said. \"Let me tell you, that's how it works. They're on the right end of the curve.\" Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, a Democrat, sounded similarly optimistic Thursday, predicting that vaccine supply will rapidly increase in February and March. The governor was fresh off a call with Pfizer, during which the company \"reiterated their plan to significantly ramp up production in February,\" said the governor's spokesman Max Reiss. Much of that ramp-up is taking place even before the Biden administration makes any moves under the Defense Production Act.  Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, appeared to agree with the assessment Thursday.   In an interview on ABC's \"Good Morning America,\" Biden's chief medical adviser expressed confidence in the President's once seemingly far-reaching goal to vaccinate 100 million people in his first 100 days.  \"I feel fairly confident that that's going to be not only that but maybe even better,\" Fauci said, adding that he had looked at the contractual agreements that had been made. \"The amount that will be coming in, we will be able to meet that goal.\"  Still, questions remain about where US vaccine supply currently stands. The new administration has touted robust federal plans to launch huge vaccination sites and deploy mobile units to hard-hit communities, at the same time some states are canceling appointments at existing vaccination sites, citing a lack of vaccine supply.  Biden's team has said it's flying somewhat blind when it comes to the supply of vaccine and how it has been allocated across the country. A source close to the transition told CNN that the Biden team had been denied access to critical resources it needed to accurately gauge the supply and prepare to take over the rollout before Biden took office. \"The cooperation or lack of cooperation funds from the Trump administration has been an impediment,\" White House Covid-19 coordinator Jeff Zients told reporters. \"So we don't have the visibility that we would hope to have into supply and allocations.\" To be sure, there's still not nearly enough vaccine available -- in the US or worldwide -- and the US has stumbled at getting shots into arms quickly. But the Biden administration also appears to be trying to manage expectations, playing up the shambles the Trump administration left behind while figuring out what concrete steps it can take to improve vaccine manufacturing and distribution. The Biden administration has not clearly articulated what it's doing to immediately improve vaccine supply, except to task agencies with looking for opportunities to use the Defense Production Act.  Biden \"absolutely remains committed to invoking the Defense Production Act in order to get the supply and the materials needed to get the vaccine out to Americans across the country and remains committed to his goal of getting 100 million shots in the arms of Americans in the first 100 days,\" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday.  The White House did not address how they would be communicating or working with states, but in a statement to CNN spokesman Kevin Munoz reiterated that they would be \"listening to the unique needs of states and tailoring the federal government's resources and guidance accordingly to ensure we are getting vaccines in the arms of Americans as quickly and safely as possible.\" White House officials said they have asked the Department of Health and Human Services to look for all potential sources of a type of syringe that can help extract more doses of the Pfizer vaccine from each vial. On Thursday, Biden said he would sign an executive order to use the Defense Production Act to direct federal agencies and private industries to \"accelerate the making of everything that's needed to protect, test, and vaccinate and the care of our people.\"  A former administration official told CNN that the Trump administration had already implemented the Defense Production Act to assist each of the six vaccine manufacturers, as well as on needle and syringe contracts. \"We'll be working paying close and careful attention to all of the components of the supply chain to ensure manufacturing keeps up with what we need,\" Tim Manning, the White House Covid supply coordinator, told reporters. \"The Defense Production Act is a powerful tool -- powerful set of tools -- and there are many ways we can use it to help ensure that there are adequate and growing supplies of vaccine.\" Samant, the vaccine expert, said the administration would be better off focusing on the availability of raw materials like lipids rather than specialized syringes. \"It's like the most ridiculous thing to chase after,\" Samant said of ramping up syringe production, adding that such a move might, at best, improve vaccine supply by 5%. For the Biden team, it's critical to understand how much supply is on hand and how much could realistically be available in the coming months. States have said they need clear and consistent guidance on vaccine supply so they can continue to streamline their vaccination programs.  \"We will work to provide projections on supply. We hear over and over from governors and local leaders that they just don't know what supply is coming and can't plan. We will absolutely across the next few days to get our arms around what's going on, make sure that we are communicating with states and localities, so they can prepare, effectively,\" Zients added. According to one health official involved in the vaccine distribution process, hospitals receiving the Moderna vaccine complained of being completely in the dark on when they were receiving it and how much they were getting and, in some cases, were sent scrambling when they received surprise shipments. Moderna declined to comment.  All these problems are now landing squarely in the lap of the new administration.  Some state officials said they're already concerned about what the administration's plan will be to allocate vaccines and communicate with states.  Under the previous administration, then-Vice President Mike Pence and members of the Covid task force held regular calls with the nation's governors during most of the pandemic. While some governors found the calls largely useless, they could at least rely on the briefings as an opportunity to hear from high-ranking medical experts and ask questions of the administration.   A day after Biden took office, state officials told CNN there is still a lot of confusion as to how states will be working and communicating with the Biden administration as the pandemic continues to surge and vaccine distribution is woefully behind.  According to one Republican state official, the National Governors Association has reached out to some of its governors about working with the Biden administration on Covid. However, not all governors are members of the organization and it remains unclear how the administration plans to work with those outside the association. A Democratic state official said they, too, had not had any regular communication with the new administration.  Dr. Bechara Choucair, the White House vaccinations coordinator, has been in touch with some governors but had not laid out how the administration would tackle vaccine allocations. Biden said Thursday that each state would be assigned a liaison with the Federal Emergency Management Agency. But in a news briefing Thursday, Psaki couldn't offer any more specifics on how the Biden administration will improve communications with states.  The new Covid team, she said, \"will be engaging with governors, Democrats and Republicans, mayors, local elected officials, to gain a better understanding of what's happening on the ground.\"  © 2019 Cable News Network.

      "13 Biden inheriting nonexistent coronavirus vaccine distribution plan and must start 'from scratch,' sources say\n",
      "http://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_8e371500b686b3021cb6a42771a58a47\n",
      "(CNN) - Newly sworn in President Joe Biden and his advisers are inheriting no coronavirus vaccine distribution plan to speak of from the Trump administration, sources tell CNN, posing a significant challenge for the new White House. The Biden administration has promised to try to turn the Covid-19 pandemic around and drastically speed up the pace of vaccinating Americans against the virus. But in the immediate hours following Biden being sworn into office on Wednesday, sources with direct knowledge of the new administration's Covid-related work told CNN one of the biggest shocks that the Biden team had to digest during the transition period was what they saw as a complete lack of a vaccine distribution strategy under former President Donald Trump, even weeks after multiple vaccines were approved for use in the United States. \"There is nothing for us to rework. We are going to have to build everything from scratch,\" one source said.  Another source described the moment that it became clear the Biden administration would have to essentially start from \"square one\" because there simply was no plan as: \"Wow, just further affirmation of complete incompetence.\" The incoming White House now faces intense pressure to make good on the promises that Biden made during the campaign and the transition phase to drastically turn things around on the pandemic and conduct himself entirely differently from Trump when it comes to the virus and vaccine distribution. During the transition period, Biden was openly critical of what he described as a \"dismal\" rollout of the Covid vaccines under the Trump administration, making clear that he placed significant blame on his predecessor for the situation he would ultimately inherit. Two Covid-19 vaccines were approved for use in the United States before Trump left office. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, around 16.5 million vaccine doses had been administered as of January 20 -- far short of the last administration's goal of administering 20 million vaccine doses by the end of 2020.  The new administration has asked some of the key players who worked on Covid and vaccines under Trump to resign from their roles, including Operation Warp Speed chief scientific adviser Moncef Slaoui and Surgeon General Jerome Adams. It has kept on others such as Dr. Anthony Fauci, who is now serving as Biden's chief medical adviser on Covid-19. Adams was asked to stay on as an adviser. In a White House press briefing Thursday afternoon, Fauci rejected the suggestion that the Biden administration would have to build a distribution plan from \"scratch.\" \"We're certainly not starting from scratch, because there is activity going on in the distribution,\" Fauci said, adding that the Biden administration is \"amplifying\" in significant ways existing vaccine distribution efforts. \"I mean we're coming in with fresh ideas, but also some ideas with ... the previous administration. You can't say it was absolutely not usable at all,\" Fauci said. Prior to Inauguration Day, some of Biden's Covid-19 advisers had wanted to be careful not to be overly critical in public of the Trump administration's handling of the virus and vaccine, given that the Biden transition team was already having a hard time getting critical information and cooperation from the outgoing administration, a source said.  Now that the transition of power has taken place, the Biden administration is hoping that they can quickly start to get a clearer picture of where things actually stand with vaccine distribution and administration across the country, going through something of a \"fact-checking\" exercise on what exactly the Trump administration had and had not done, they added. CNN has previously reported that the Biden team's most urgent concerns on Covid-19 include potential vaccine supply problems, coordination between federal and local governments, as well as funding, staffing and other resource needs for local governments. That is in addition to the emerging Covid variants, which the new White House -- in consultation with scientists and experts -- is watching warily.  Biden has made clear that slowing down the spread of Covid-19 and getting 100 million vaccine shots into Americans' arms in his first 100 days in office are of utmost priority -- goals that will shape whether Biden's first years in office are ultimately deemed successful.  Within hours of being sworn into office, Biden signed an executive order requiring masks on all federal property, a part of his campaign promise to push for a federal mask mandate during his first 100 days in office.  \"This is going to be the first of many engagements we're going to have in here,\" Biden said in his first appearance in the Oval Office as president. \"I thought with the state of the nation today there's no time to waste. Get to work immediately.\" On Biden's first full day in office on Thursday, the White House is focusing on Covid-19 by rolling out a national strategy for getting the pandemic under control including numerous executive actions related to vaccination and testing. Criticizing the \"lack of cooperation\" from the Trump administration as an \"impediment\" for the new administration, White House Covid coordinator Jeff Zients told reporters on Wednesday that he was still confident that the administration can meet its 100 million vaccine shots in 100 days target. \"For almost a year now, Americans could not look to the federal government for any strategy, let alone a comprehensive approach to respond to Covid,\" Zients said. \"And we've seen the tragic costs of that failure. As President Biden steps into office today ... that'll change tomorrow.\" This story has been updated with additional reporting. © 2019 Cable News Network. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.

      "14 Biden unveils Covid-19 plan based on 'science not politics' as he signs new initiatives\n",
      "http://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_4514536cdaff2ce517ce85859c46eb7c\n",
      "(CNN) - President Joe Biden's first full day in office on Thursday focused on rolling out his national strategy to get the coronavirus pandemic under control and signing several executive actions, including ramping up vaccination supplies and requiring international travelers to provide proof of a negative Covid-19 test prior to traveling to the US. \"Our national strategy is comprehensive, it's based on science, not politics. It's based on truth, not denial, and it's detailed,\" Biden said, speaking from the White House. He said the 198-page plan is posted on WhiteHouse.gov.  Biden's plan starts with a national vaccination campaign in order to meet the President's goal of administering 100 million shots, which is enough to cover 50 million Americans with vaccines that require two doses, in his first 100 days in office.  \"We're at Day 1,\" Biden said.  He said the plan was developed with input from the nation's top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, among other advisers and experts. Fauci was at the event at the White House, along with Biden's Covid czar Jeff Zients.  Biden said the American public would be \"hearing a lot more from Dr. Fauci again, not from the President, but from the real genuine experts and scientists.\"  Former President Donald Trump sidelined and undermined his own medical experts as the pandemic raged across the country.  \"We're going to make sure they work free from political interference and that they make decisions strictly based on science and health care alone, science and health alone, not what the political consequences are,\" Biden said.  The day after being sworn-in, Biden signed at least 10 executive orders, memorandums and directives focused on tackling the pandemic, which, as of Thursday afternoon, has claimed the lives of more than 408,000 Americans and infected more than 24 million in the US.  Biden signed executive orders ramping up supplies for vaccination, testing and personal protective equipment and another boosting development of therapeutics to treat Covid-19.  Biden emphasized the need for Americans to wear face masks in order to stop the spread of the virus, saying masks are \"even more important than the vaccines.\" The President, who has long stressed the importance of mask-wearing, signed an executive order on his first day in office requiring masks in federal buildings and on federal lands, and asked Americans to wear masks for his first 100 days in office.  Following through on his campaign proposals, Biden signed two executive orders creating a National Pandemic Testing Board to improve US coronavirus testing capacity and a Covid-19 Health Equity Task Force to ensure an \"equitable\" pandemic response and recovery. Another executive order he signed enhance the nation's collection, production, sharing and analysis of data about the virus. He directed the Federal Emergency Management Agency to offer full reimbursement to states for the cost of National Guard personnel and emergency supplies such as PPE for schools. Biden asked the Department of Education and Department of Health and Human Services to provide guidance for safe reopening and operating of schools, childcare providers, and institutions of higher education.  He signed an executive order calling on the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to release clear guidance on Covid-19, decide whether to establish emergency temporary standards, and directs OSHA to enforce worker health and safety requirements. Building on the order he signed Wednesday making masks mandatory on federal property, Biden also took action to require facial coverings in airports and on certain modes of transportation, including many trains, planes, maritime vessels and intercity buses.  Biden is also issuing a presidential directive to restore America's leadership, support the international pandemic response effort, promote resilience for future threats, and advance global health security and the Global Health Security Agenda. Newly-installed White House Covid coordinator Jeff Zients told reporters Wednesday that Biden's pandemic strategy will be \"a fundamentally different approach from the Trump administration,\" and will be \"driven by science, data, and public health\" -- not politics.  CNN reported Thursday that Biden and his advisers are inheriting a nonexistent coronavirus vaccine distribution plan to speak of from the Trump administration, with sources telling CNN that they'll have to essentially \"build everything from scratch.\"  \"For almost a year now, Americans could not look to the federal government for any strategy, let alone a comprehensive approach to respond to COVID. And we've seen the tragic costs of that failure. As President Biden steps into office today that, that'll change tomorrow,\" Zients said Wednesday.  After his swearing-in ceremony Wednesday, Biden's first action as President was to impose a mask mandate on federal property. Biden also installed a coronavirus response coordinator to oversee the White House's efforts to distribute vaccines and medical supplies. He also signed an executive order halting US withdrawal from the World Health Organization. © 2019 Cable News Network. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

      "15 Video calls and at-home business casual: West Wing jobs in the time of Covid\n",
      "http://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_6fd12c12c993f362ff9a841c76633637\n",
      "(CNN) - Landing a West Wing job is a dream-come-true for most any political staffer, even with the long hours, cramped working conditions and around-the-clock pressure.  Doing it remotely, it turns out, is slightly less glamorous. \"I would love to have seen and been there for what it was like before Covid,\" an administration official said wistfully on Thursday. \"It looks so beautiful, but I hear it's empty.\" Indeed, on President Joe Biden's first full day in office, aides described the West Wing as anything but the hive of bustling and chaotic activity seen in previous administrations -- or certainly as dramatized on NBC's \"The West Wing\" or countless political films.  A small contingent of staff, including Biden's senior-most aides and those needed to support the President and Oval Office operations, are in place. But the majority of staffers will work remotely, at least for now, as coronavirus rages and the new President looks to better model his government's own recommendations. The roster of those working inside the West Wing so far this week includes: Ron Klain, White House chief of staff; Jen Psaki, press secretary; Kate Bedingfield, communications director; Jeff Zients, Covid-19 coordinator; Jake Sullivan, national security adviser; Brian Deese, director of the National Economic Council; and Cedric Richmond, director of the office of public engagement. A White House official said aides who were working from home were utilizing \"a variety of tools to stay in touch and carry out their work.\" That isn't to say that all of Biden's new staff is not busy. The President is entering office on a policymaking spree, dismantling the previous President's agenda while instituting new plans to combat coronavirus, manage immigration and battle climate change. The amount of documents to write, bullet points to approve, language to vet and events to plan far exceeds other recent administrations, at least in the opening hours. It's just that many of the people executing the work are sitting at their kitchen tables, in their spare bedrooms or, if they are fortunate enough, in their home offices. Staffers are managing the administration's intensive early days through conference calls, video meetings and over email. The set-up has made for some Covid-era adjustments. Before former President Donald Trump left office this week, the White House IT department installed cameras on computers throughout the West Wing the night before Biden was inaugurated to better facilitate video calls for the new administration. Working clothes in times of coronavirus Several members of the Biden administration's new team dressed up for their virtual swearing-in session with the President on Wednesday. Word spread among the staffers beforehand that campaign attire like sweatshirts and fleece pullovers would not be appropriate. So even though they were only appearing on a tiny box in a monitor -- rather than in person in the State Dining Room -- suit jackets, shirts and ties were in order.  The concept of working remotely is hardly a new one, particularly for those who did so during the last eight months of the campaign after the Biden headquarters in Philadelphia shuttered in the early days of the pandemic. But it doesn't make it any less frustrating, when the new office is at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. While many officials worked in the Obama-Biden administration, others did not, making the remote working environment even more of a disappointment, considering the pandemic was unfathomable at the dawn of the 2020 campaign. Many will stop by the White House in some capacity over the coming days to pick up equipment and receive ID badges, but the work-from-home orders are in place for the foreseeable future. That means, for now, no walking into one of the most famous buildings in the world for work or looking out the window to see Marine One lifting off from the South Lawn. No lunches picked up from the takeout window of the Navy mess or taco Wednesdays at Ike's Eatery in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. And no after-hours tours of the West Wing to peek into the iconic Roosevelt or Cabinet rooms. In a building where proximity equals power, work-from-home staffers are also deprived of the type of casual run-in or last-minute pull-aside with their superiors -- or even the President -- that could help spark policy or determine strategy. By all accounts, Biden is not running his White House like Trump, where casual visitors or low-level staffers often found themselves in the Oval Office as Trump upended his meetings and briefings for arcane tangents. But as many Americans have learned during the pandemic, even the most buttoned-up offices lose something of the organic flow when workers are stuck at home. Limited real estate The virtual scenario has, however, eased one ritual of a new administration: fighting for remarkably limited real estate in West Wing offices or even in the more sprawling Eisenhower Executive Office Building just a stone's throw from the White House. For now, many of those offices are assigned but empty as staffers ride out the pandemic working from home. Vice President Kamala Harris has moved into her West Wing office, although she maintains a far more spacious and ceremonial quarters in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. Officials said they received new government computers and phones that were activated at noon on Wednesday, allowing them to conduct official business from living rooms, kitchens and home offices. National Security Council staff who arrived to work at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on Thursday were largely sent home and told they will be teleworking for the foreseeable future due to stricter Covid-19 measures being imposed by the administration. According to an administration official, only \"continuity of operations\" staff will be allowed to work inside the building, which includes the national security adviser and his top advisers, as well as the heads of a few key directorates and other key personnel. Other staffers who need to access top secret information would be allowed in on an ad hoc basis, this official said. Many staffers who had been going in previously are being told that they'll have to stay home. But other mid-level and lower level staffers will work from home, a departure from Trump aides who mostly continued coming to work without wearing masks. Psaki said during her press briefing on Wednesday that all staffers entering the complex will be required to undergo a Covid test, wear an N95 mask and adhere to social distancing guidelines. Plexiglass barriers were also mounted on desks in the West Wing, something Trump officials had resisted. \"The President has asked us to also be models to the American people, and that's vitally important to us as well,\" she said.

      "16 Fauci talks 'liberating feeling' serving under Biden versus Trump\n",
      "http://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_d756707831a77ad2d6e9bf96e5beb262\n",
      "(CNN) - When Dr. Anthony Fauci returned to the White House briefing room on Thursday, he did so without the sour reality of a hostile president watching him from feet away in the Oval Office. \"I can tell you, I take no pleasure at all in being in a situation of contradicting the President,\" Fauci told the room, appearing nonetheless to take some pleasure in no longer having to dance around President Donald Trump's turbulent ego. \"The idea that you can get up here and talk about what you know, what the evidence, what the science is -- let the science speak,\" he added. \"It is somewhat of a liberating feeling.\" He demurred somewhat on his rocky history with the previous administration. But he made no attempt to veil his pleasure at the changing of guard. For the 80-year-old infectious disease specialist, it was the latest act in a long history of serving seven US presidents. Fauci, who sat on Trump's coronavirus task force and endured Trump's public scorn, emerged to tout a new administration's plans and voice support for a new President's approach. In some ways it was a turnabout. Though he was sidelined and ignored in the end, he still helped formulate a badly flawed Trump administration policy that failed to contain the virus. But when things began to get bad, Trump's aides restricted how much Fauci could appear on television to offer warnings and disinvited him from briefing the President in the Oval Office. Fauci and Trump disagreed on how to approach the pandemic, what the correct message was for the American people and how to balance reopening with preventing further contagion. Through it all, Trump insisted he respected Fauci but disagreed with his approach. But at their relationship's nadir, Trump suggested he was considering firing Fauci. Attacks from Trump's allies led to death threats and enhanced security. It was a different scene on Thursday. Fauci awoke before 4 a.m. ET to address the World Health Organization on the administration's behalf after Biden rejoined the body. In the State Dining Room several hours later, Biden and Fauci greeted each other warmly before Biden signed a series of executive actions meant to combat the pandemic. He appeared for a number of television interviews. He was the first administration expert to stand in the briefing room under new management. Fauci himself said he was guaranteed a new approach. \"One of the things that was very clear as recently as about 15 minutes ago, when I was with the President, is that one of the things that we're going to do is to be completely transparent, open and honest,\" Fauci said. \"If things go wrong, not point fingers but to correct them. And to make everything we do be based on science and evidence.\" \"That was literally a conversation I had 15 minutes ago with the President,\" he said, clearly relieved the stark warnings he's been trying to convey about the pandemic for months would now come with the imprimatur of the White House. \"We are still in a very serious situation,\" Fauci said as he began his remarks, calling the recently passed death toll of 400,000 \"historic in a very bad sense.\" He suggested that the recent seven-day average of cases \"looks like it might actually be plateauing in the sense of turning around,\" and the public health officials \"think it's real.\" But, he added, he's said this before. \"I'm sort of getting a déjà vu standing up here cause I said something like this almost a little bit less than a year ago when we were talking about the acceleration of cases in the late winter, early spring of 2020, when we were having New York City metropolitan area being the epicenter of what was going on. There are always lags, so please be aware of that,\" he said. That, of course, was before Trump decided Fauci's urgent warnings were dampening Americans' spirits and, in turn, his political prospects. By summer, Trump had taken to insisting the country was \"rounding the corner\" on the virus. By the time another surge hit in the fall, Trump was in full denial. Fauci went for weeks without speaking with Trump. Two days before the election, Trump suggested to a crowd in Florida he might fire Fauci. The doctor continued to attend task force meetings with Pence, and appeared at a briefing with Pence in November, but his relationship had died with Trump -- who'd taken to a new adviser, Dr. Scott Atlas, whose views were on the fringe. On Thursday, Fauci signaled the days of overconfidence and loose facts were over.  \"One of the things new with this administration is if you don't know the answer, don't guess,\" he said. \"Just say you don't know the answer.\" © 2019 Cable News Network.

      "17 Dr. Sanjay Gupta: The United States' one-year coronavirus checkup\n",
      "http://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_0e1a2ddf94eeb132a5bdeecdda84a602\n",
      "(CNN) - We have entered the era of coronavirus anniversaries. Today marks one year since the announcement of the first patient with Covid-19 in the United States. It happened in Washington state, where a male in his 30s who had just returned from visiting Wuhan, China, started experiencing symptoms and quickly sought help at a clinic.  Unlike in the movies or on TV, where a sick patient staggers into a hospital waiting room infecting everyone nearby, the doctors and public health experts in Washington state were prepared: They had been carefully monitoring what was going on in China and had been running drills to practice what to do when  -- not if -- an infected patient arrived at their doorstep. This patient was tested, hospitalized and isolated, contact-traced, treated and eventually released. Even though this person became the first patient identified, he was almost certainly not THE first case in the country. Over the course of the last year, one patient has grown exponentially into 24 million confirmed in the US alone -- a number that is surely only the tip of the iceberg, the cases we know about. Anniversaries are important and meaningful to us. They're a way of marking the passage of time and noting historical events, delineating the Before and After. And with the start of our second year dealing with this novel coronavirus, which almost exactly coincides with the start of 2021, we will be noting many more Firsts of the Covid-19 Pandemic: the first complete lockdown of a city, Wuhan (1/23); the first time the World Health Organization declared coronavirus a \"public health emergency of international concern\" (1/30); the first death outside of mainland China (2/2); the introduction of the name \"Covid-19\" -- the disease caused by the novel coronavirus -- into the popular lexicon (2/11); the first known US death (2/29)-- although health officials would later amend that milestone (2/6). And I'll never forget March 9, the first time I, on CNN, used the word \"pandemic\" to describe what was happening. Two days later, WHO did the same.  The nature of 'novel' All these firsts make me think about the significance of the word \"novel.\" When was the last time we, as adults and as a society, truly experienced anything for the first time, or have been in a situation for which we had no context?  When we hear of a novel -- or new -- anything, one of the first things we, as humans, start doing is contextualizing or looking for similar examples among the things we are familiar with. We try to understand the contours of this new entity by comparing it to what we already have stored in our memories and experiences. We look for patterns, similarities, overlap. It's human nature.  But, too often, that  sort of thinking gets in our way.  When this novel coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2, emerged, many scientists, public health officials and doctors -- myself included -- looked to other deadly coronaviruses, such as SARS and MERS, for clues to predict how it would behave. We also tried to compare it to the seasonal influenza virus and to past flu pandemics, like the one caused by the H1N1 subtype, which set off both the 2009 and the 1918 pandemics. I remember putting my head down deep into this, taking in all the information I could: reading research papers and unpublished pre-proofs; talking to colleagues in China, South Korea, Japan and at my hospital; talking to experts like Dr. Anthony Fauci and global health expert Peter Daszak, whose research has been key to understanding the origin and impact of emerging diseases. And I remember, everybody had a theory about some aspect of this novel coronavirus -- even my mother had a theory. In the earliest days, we thought human-to-human transmissibility was unlikely, that masks weren't particularly helpful, that it might not be deadlier than the flu, that people couldn't spread it asymptomatically or through the air. Maybe we hoped these things would be true, and the pandemic wouldn't be as devastating as it has been. But we were wrong. We quickly  learned that SARS-CoV-2 was much deadlier than the flu, and much more easily transmissible than either of its close cousins, SARS and MERS. We came to terms with the sobering reality that aerosolized particles and asymptomatic carriers are significant drivers of its relentless spread.  The point is, I don't think anyone would have predicted -- or wanted to predict -- we'd be dealing with a global pandemic of this magnitude one year later. We didn't want to face such a grim future.  Even the way former President Donald Trump communicated to me that he didn't want to panic the American public likely contributed  to the problem. But being honest and direct, and telling people the truth, is sometimes hard. I deal with this as a doctor all the time. A traumatic brain injury after a car accident on the way to work. That headache: the early sign of a brain tumor. I have learned that presenting a problem alongside a plan doesn't soften the blow of terrible news, but it can help mitigate the panic, which really serves no purpose. It also makes it much more  likely people will take the issue seriously, rather than simply feeling helpless, which can lead to disbelief and ignoring the problem altogether.  If I had known in January of last year that we'd still be living this Covid lockdown life, and that I'd still be conducting interviews from my basement until, say, a vaccine was developed, in many ways it would have been a very difficult pill to swallow. But in at least one way it would have been easier: There would be a calendar, a timetable, about how things should progress -- and a tangible end. The certainty of a countdown to zero, as opposed to the inherent ambiguity of counting up for what feels like forever. We're not nearly as good at counting up as we are at counting down. However painful, when we countdown, we still have the anticipation of an end date.  Pondering the pandemic  Anniversaries are also a time to reflect, to look back on this experience and assess what we got right versus what we got wrong.  We got a few big things right: We made remarkable progress in scientific and medical arenas, like developing protocols and therapeutics -- both repurposed and new -- for people who got sick. Most notable of all, we managed to develop several vaccine candidates and even authorized two with astonishing speed. But we also got too many things wrong -- most consequentially and tragically the public health basics, the things that are far easier to do but not as flashy: wearing a mask and staying physically distanced from those not in our household. We eschewed the inexpensive mask that slips on easily, yet embraced the billion-dollar breakthrough vaccine that takes a Herculean effort to develop and distribute. The truth is, especially for many of us in the developed world, we want science to rescue us -- but it can't rescue us from ourselves; our own human nature. And our human nature is not good at dealing with what it can't see. The other day, someone asked me what big breakthrough I would like to see for a future pandemic. Aside from the obvious ones -- avoiding a future pandemic, developing an effective vaccine, having access to effective medications, amassing reliable data—here's a crazy idea I would love: fluorescent dye that basically gives the virus just a little bit of color. So if someone is infected, you could see a little plume of glowing green particles coming out of their nose and mouth. Not to scare people or gross them out, but because we are so much better at dealing with things that we can tangibly identify than an invisible threat. Trying to get people to believe in what they can't see, trying to prove a negative (for example, reliably conveying all the deaths mask-wearing prevented) has always been the challenge in all preventive medicine. On the other side Looking forward, I am optimistic, medically-speaking. I think once most of us are vaccinated, SARS-CoV-2 will become like the other circulating coronaviruses, an annual nuisance but not an existential threat. The image of the United States as a public health leader, however, has been tarnished by the events of the last year and its inability to control the pandemic at home. It's a fact, and we can't spin the statistics to our advantage: We have 4% of the world's population but 25% of known Covid infections and 20% of deaths. Can the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the country's premier public health agency, regain some of its lost prestige domestically and abroad? I believe with hard work and time, it can. But beyond that, the country will be scarred psychologically and emotionally for a long time, especially the people who have lost family members to Covid-19, the health care workers who fought tirelessly -- sometimes in the face of disbelief or worse -- to care for the sick, the children of all ages who lost a year of school and struggled to catch up, the families who lost income from layoffs or suffered other economic catastrophes, the owners who had to shutter their businesses. The list goes on.  I have no doubt we will get through this. And hopefully there will be lessons learned, but more importantly, lessons remembered -- because those who forget history are doomed to repeat it, and the price we've paid as a society during this pandemic is too high to let that happen again. This past year has most certainly taught us that.  © 2019 Cable News Network. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

      "18 CNN Poll: Americans' willingness to get the coronavirus vaccine is on the rise\n",
      "http://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_128e905c2345276fb6c814eba97e0053\n",
      "(CNN) - Two-thirds of Americans (66%) say they will try to get vaccinated now that multiple Covid-19 vaccines are approved and beginning to be made available to the public, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS. That's up from about half in October (51%), before any vaccines had been approved for use.  The rollout of vaccines to fight the virus -- which has shut down much of the country for nearly a year -- appears to be tilting public opinion toward optimism that the worst is behind us. Overall, 49% say the worst of the coronavirus outbreak in the United States is behind us (up from 44% in October), while 47% say that the worst is ahead. Among those who say the worst is behind, 62% say they feel that way because there are vaccines available. No other reason reaches double-digits, but 9% each cite the administration change in the White House and that we know more about the virus now.  On the other side, among those who say the worst is still to come, no single reason dominates, but many say their pessimism is because people are not taking the virus seriously or not following guidelines (18%), vaccines are not widely available yet (17%) or the recent rise in cases and deaths (17%).  The longstanding partisan divides in views on the coronavirus are still largely in place, though the change in power at the White House appears to be driving some shifts. With an incoming Democratic administration, Democrats are starting to hold a more positive outlook on the pandemic (38% say the worst is behind, the largest share to say so since the start of the outbreak) while Republicans are becoming more negative about it (30% say the worst is ahead, the highest since April and nearly doubled since October, when 16% felt that way).  And Democrats are increasingly willing to get the coronavirus vaccine (from 61% in October to 83% now), while among Republicans, that number has held about even (45% in October, 49% now).  Beyond the partisan shift in willingness to get a coronavirus vaccine, there has also been a 27-point increase in the percentage of those age 65 or older who are willing to be vaccinated (from 60% in early October to 87% now). Among younger adults, the changes are smaller, holding roughly steady among those under age 35 at 55% willing to get a vaccine, up 10 points to 58% among those age 35 to 49, and up 21 points to 69% among those from age 50 to age 64. The survey finds partisan agreement, though, that the distribution of vaccines so far, which has been limited largely to health care workers and older adults, has mostly been fair. Overall, 75% say so, including 79% of Republicans, 78% of independents and 69% of Democrats.  Results from the same poll released earlier this week found that Americans largely expect President Joe Biden to be able to achieve his pledge of ensuring that 100 million doses of the coronavirus vaccine are administered by the 100-day mark of his presidency (70% said that is likely to happen, including 90% of Democrats, 69% of independents and 47% of Republicans).  Most Americans say they only occasionally or rarely feel that people around them in public are doing too little to prevent the spread of the virus (56%), while 42% say they feel that way all or most of the time. Half of Democrats say they feel people around them aren't doing enough most of the time (50%), while that dips to 36% among Republicans. About half (48%) say they are experiencing financial hardship due to the coronavirus, including 13% who say it's a severe hardship, those numbers are roughly the same as when CNN last polled on this question in August. Methodology  The methodology and weighting for this poll have been modified compared with previous CNN polls. Interviews conducted on cell phones made up 75% of the total, up from 65% in prior surveys. Dialing extended over six days rather than four days, allowing for more effort to be made to contact those who are not easily reachable. Demographic weighting was adjusted to account for more discrete education categories broken out by race, and a geographic weight was applied to ensure representative distribution by population density. In addition, results were weighted for p                artisan identification and lean among independents, with targets computed using an average of the current poll plus three recent CNN polls. The new CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS January 9 through 14 among a random national sample of 1,003 adults reached on landlines or cellphones by a live interviewer. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points. © 2019 Cable News Network. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

      "19 CDC forecasts up to 100,000 more Covid-19 deaths in the next few weeks\n",
      "http://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_0f570d98d38682ec4f0d908dcf8e06fc\n",
      "(CNN) - Covid-19 vaccinations will not only help stop the virus from spreading, they will also hamper the coronavirus' ability to mutate into new variants, Dr. Anthony Fauci said on Thursday.  \"Viruses don't mutate unless they replicate,\" Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said at a news briefing at the White House, his first under the administration of President Joe Biden. \"And if you can suppress that by a very good vaccine campaign, then you could actually avoid this deleterious effect that you might get from the mutations,\" Fauci said.  Fauci's remarks come as scientists around the world attempt to decipher what the new variants may mean for those who've been vaccinated or have antibodies to the virus.  While a few recent studies suggest that a variant first detected in South Africa may be a problem, even for people who have been vaccinated, at least one recent study found evidence that people vaccinated against coronavirus will be protected against new variants. The South African variant has not yet been detected in the United States. Other variants include one first identified in the United Kingdom and one found in Brazil. Researchers at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles found a new strain in one-third of their patients that may have contributed to the recent explosion of cases there, the hospital reported recently. \"The strain, which the investigators designated as CAL.20C, is believed to be in part responsible for the dramatic increase in cases over the last two months,\" Cedars-Sinai said in a release. The researchers' findings do not indicate that the strain is more deadly, the hospital said, but Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said Thursday that \"when more people get it, it passes more quickly, and more people die because of that.\" 'A constant pattern of basically running out' of vaccine If enough people get vaccinated by the end of summer, the US could start nearing a sense of normalcy by the fall, Fauci said.  \"If we get 70% to 85% of the country vaccinated, let's say by the end of the summer, middle of the summer, I believe by the time we get to the fall we will be approaching a degree of normality,\" Fauci said. Two-thirds of Americans say they will try to get vaccinated, according to a new CNN poll conducted by the research firm SSRS. While that's a higher number than past polls, Fauci said his concern is that not enough people will be willing to be vaccinated, \"because many people are skeptical about that.\" For now, however, demand is strong for the available vaccine. For a second time, more than a million vaccine shots were given in a single day, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced on Thursday. More than 17.5 million vaccine doses had been administered in the US, and almost 2.4 million Americans have been fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. And the push to get people vaccinated has grown even as officials work to meet demand with limited supply.  \"Demand for the vaccine will be much greater than the supply for some time,\" Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said in a Thursday news conference.  She said her state is 46th nationally in the amount of doses allocated, with just 19,500 doses each week, though the state is ranked 15th for administering the vaccine. She's not sure why the state is receiving few doses but hopes that Iowa will be allocated more doses in the coming weeks, perhaps by the first week of February.  \"We are doing a lot with relatively little vaccine,\" Reynolds said.  New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the state is administering about 65,000 doses a day -- a rate that will deplete its current supply in two or three days. \"What's clear now is that we will be going from week to week and you will see a constant pattern of basically running out, waiting for the next week's allocation and then starting up again,\" Cuomo said.  The state will receive 250,400 doses next week, but Cuomo urged President Biden to increase the supply to states immediately. \"At this current rate of supply, it takes seven and a half months to get enough vaccine for the currently eligible population,\" Cuomo said.  Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers issued a statewide mask mandate on Tuesday while the state waited for more vaccine doses.  \"At the end of the day, vaccine supplies are limited, so while we continue to ask the federal government for more vaccines and faster, we have to keep working together to stop the spread today,\" Evers said, \"by continuing to wear our masks, staying home whenever we can, avoiding gatherings, and doubling down on our efforts to keep our friends, neighbors, and families safe.\"  Biden: US Death toll likely to top half a million in February The Covid-19 death toll in the US will likely top 500,000 next month, President Biden said in a news conference Thursday, as he portrayed his administration's plan to respond to the pandemic as a \"wartime undertaking.\" Part of that plan involves asking Americans to wear masks for the first 100 days of his administration -- a step that could save thousands of lives, he said -- as it works to improve the vaccine rollout.  \"The masks have become a partisan issue, unfortunately,\" Biden said, \"but it's a patriotic act.\" \"The fact is they're the single best thing we can do,\" he said. \"If we do this as Americans, the experts say by wearing a mask from now until April, we'd save more than 50,000 lives.\"  More than 408,000 Americans have died of Covid-19 as of Thursday afternoon, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. More than 62,000 deaths have been recorded this month, making January 2021 the second deadliest month of the pandemic, behind December 2020. Biden's warning of tens of thousands more deaths in just a few weeks echoes the latest ensemble forecast by the CDC, which projects the death toll could reach up to 508,000 by February 13.  Biden's remarks came on his first full day in office, which marked one year since the first patient with Covid-19 was identified in the US. That number has since ballooned to more than 24.5 million as of Thursday, according to Johns Hopkins. The President signed a series of executive orders to address the crisis on several fronts, including setting up a pandemic testing board. \"Let me be clear: Things are going to get worse before they get better,\" Biden said, adding that a memorial he held for Covid-19 victims this week will not be the last.  \"But let me be equally clear: We will get through this. We will defeat this pandemic,\" he said.  Biden team tackles Covid-19 There remain significant challenges with vaccine supply across the country, according to state officials. And sources tell CNN that Biden and his advisers are inheriting no coronavirus vaccine distribution plan from the outgoing Trump administration. Fauci, Biden's chief medical adviser, said the United States can reach the President's goal of 100 million shots in 100 days -- and may even be able to surpass it.\"  \"The President has made this his top priority,\" Fauci told ABC's \"Good Morning America,\" adding he was set to meet with Biden later Thursday to brief him on Covid-19 and vaccine distribution.  \"As he says, he's going to do everything that he needs to do to make sure we have a successful rollout of the vaccines, get it into people's arms and get as many people vaccinated as we possibly can,\" Fauci said.  Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont said he believes there is a \"real chance\" that vaccine production could double by the end of February and double again by the end of March if President Biden uses to Defense Production Act to \"jumpstart\" production. Lamont was recently named a co-chair for the National Governors Association's Pandemic and Disaster Response Task Force.  New CDC director Dr. Rochelle Walensky on Thursday told NBC News the agency was working with the federal government's Operation Warp Speed, vaccine manufacturers and the states to understand the supply issues. But in the meantime, \"right now, I think we still have vaccine on the shelves that we need to get into people,\" she said. Federal officials are looking at a \"diverse\" rollout plan, she said, involving community vaccination centers, stadiums and mobile units to get vaccines to everyone across the country. Biden also announced the US would rejoin the World Health Organization, a move Fauci said was important for an effective global response.  \"The official announcement that we are rejoining, we're going to live up to our financial commitments and a whole bunch of other things, it was really a very good day,\" Fauci said. \"The response I'm getting from my colleagues all over the world is really very, very refreshing.\" New cases slightly down While the US is far from out of the woods, CNN analysis of Johns Hopkins data shows slight dips in new daily cases. New cases are down 21% compared to last week, the largest week-over-week drop since the pandemic began. As of Wednesday the average number of new cases over the last seven days remained high, at 194,252 -- but that marked a dip below the 200,000 per day average the country has consistently seen for weeks. As of Thursday morning, 43 states were reporting decreases in new Covid-19 cases greater than 10% compared to last week, according to CNN's analysis. Six states -- Maine, New Hampshire, New Jersey, South Carolina, Texas and Vermont -- were holding steady compared to the week prior. Only Virginia showed an upward trend in cases greater than 10% compared to last week.  And according to data from the COVID Tracking Project, the US has a 9.81% positivity rate over the last seven days, dropping below the 10% threshold for the first time since late November.  © 2019 Cable News Network.

      "20 Biden's DOJ must confront what to with outstanding cases in which it is defending Trump. The first test could come Friday.\n",
      "http://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_5923317d2442b4152049aa89aa490b9e\n",
      "(CNN) - As the Biden administration begins to take shape, one key question President Joe Biden's Justice Department must confront is whether to continue defending Donald Trump, who relied on Department of Justice lawyers to fight some of his personal battles. Friday may be the first test of how the Justice Department will handle some of these issues. Lawyers will be in court in Washington, DC, for a case involving the House Ways & Means Committee's attempt to obtain Trump's tax returns from federal agencies that have them. Trump broke with the tradition of a president voluntarily disclosing his tax returns. At stake is whether the Biden administration will back out of legal proceedings making their way through the courts in which Justice Department lawyers under the former President tried to protect Trump and others. The Senate has not yet set a hearing date for Biden's nominee for US Attorney General, Judge Merrick Garland, so it's not clear how quickly decisions on these cases will be made. The Justice Department serves as the lawyer for government agencies and Office of the President in civil litigation, such as defending executive orders, policies, and fights over executive privilege. During his four years as president, Trump's Justice Department was called on to intervene in cases that affected him personally.  Last fall the Department of Justice moved to substitute itself for Trump in a defamation lawsuit brought by E. Jean Carroll, who accused the former President of raping her in the mid-1990s. A federal judge ruled against the Justice Department, but in the waning days of Trump's presidency, the department appealed the decision.  Trump also relied on department lawyers to serve his interests, whether it was to block the release of his tax returns or to sue over a tell-all book published by Melania Trump's former friend, Stephanie Winston Wolkoff. In the case involving Trump's tax returns that will be in court Friday, the Treasury Department, formerly led by Steven Mnuchin, denied the request in 2019, prompting the Democrat-led House committee to sue.  The Justice Department represented the Treasury Department in the case, as is normal, but now it's unclear whether Biden's Treasury and Justice departments will continue to block the request. The Justice Department declined to comment for this story. The case has been slow moving. Judge Trevor McFadden of the DC District Court has taken cues from other separation of powers fights in which the House and Trump -- or the Justice Department on his behalf -- have gone to court in a standoff. The parameters of executive privilege are ones every administration and Justice Department grapple with. The difference with the Trump administration was how aggressively it fought with Congress on every request it made.  McFadden essentially kept the tax return case at bay while appeals courts worked out a related question, whether the House could force former Trump White House counsel Don McGahn to testify about Trump's attempts to obstruct the Russia investigation.  As of now, McGahn has not testified, and the Internal Revenue Service has not handed over the tax returns. During the latter half of Trump's term in office, the McGahn case became the major test for how far the federal courts would go in responding to House subpoena enforcement requests that had been blocked by a recalcitrant executive branch or Trump himself. The McGahn case is set for arguments at the DC Circuit Court of Appeals in late February. In a court filing this week, private attorneys for Trump identified a potential change in policy under Biden as a possible outcome, and asked McFadden for a hearing. Their concern is that the Biden administration may not oppose the request for Trump's tax returns and quietly release them to the House committee. According to Trump's lawyer, the House Committee indicated that it is \"not in a position at this time to speak for the incoming administration regarding release of President Trump's tax-return information to the Committee.\" The House committees that have filed subpoenas involving Trump's tax returns and financial documents have said they plan to renew those subpoenas in the new Congress this year, although they have yet to formally do so because the congressional committees have not yet organized. House aides say that conversations with the Biden Justice Department about how to settle the congressional cases are likely to wait until after top Biden officials like Garland have been confirmed. © 2019 Cable News Network.

      "21 National Guard allowed back into Capitol complex after lawmakers erupt at banishment to parking garage\n",
      "http://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_d1cc00695c6f86143e316c3b5f5e5969\n",
      "(CNN) - Thousands of National Guardsmen have been moved to a parking garage after they were told they could no longer use space within the US Capitol Complex, including areas like the cafeteria of a Senate office building, as a rest area, multiple Guardsmen told CNN.  Prior to Thursday morning, several areas throughout the Capitol Complex were designated as authorized rest areas where members of the Guard could take breaks from their shifts protecting Capitol. By Thursday morning, all those areas had been cleared out and their designations removed, the Guardsmen said. \"We honestly just feel betrayed,\" one guardsman told CNN, noting that a day before, congressmen had come by for photos with the different National Guards units that came to Washington to support security around the inauguration. \"After everything went seamlessly, we were deemed useless and banished to a corner of a parking garage.\" Politico was first to report on the guardsmen's situation. Pictures provided to CNN show guardsmen sitting or lying down in areas cordoned off with caution tape. Some appear to be sleeping by resting against concrete pillars in the garage, just a few feet away from parked cars. There was one electrical outlet and one bathroom with two stalls for 5,000 troops, one guardsman told CNN. Though many of the troops in the pictures are wearing masks, some are not, which the guardsman said was against guidance and a serious Covid risk, calling it \"totally unacceptable.\" \"Our guidance is if you're not eating or drinking, you need to be wearing a mask. We've already had just some in my unit alone test positive for Covid, and they're just keeping us packed together with caution tape in small areas,\" said that guardsman. \"And that's the only authorized rest area.\" Approximately 25,000 National Guard troops were called up from all 50 states and the District of Columbia because of heightened security concerns around the inauguration of President Joe Biden. Many used the café of the Dirksen Senate Office Building, just northwest of the Capitol, as a rest area to relax, charge phones and get wireless internet. But on Thursday afternoon, the guardsmen who spoke with CNN said they could no longer use the cafeteria and could only rest in the parking garage of the nearby Thurgood Marshall Judicial Center. The National Guard Bureau said the troop relocation was temporary because Congress is in session. \"The National Guard continues to assist and support the U.S. Capitol Police. As Congress is in session and increased foot traffic and business is being conducted, Capitol Police asked the troops to move their rest area. They were temporarily relocated to the Thurgood Marshall Judicial Center garage with heat and restroom facilities. We remain an agile and flexible force to provide for the safety and security of the Capitol and its surrounding areas,\" the National Guard Bureau said in a statement. A request for comment from the Capitol Police was not returned. After Politico reported the story, members of Congress tweeted their concern over the situation with Sen. Mike Lee, a Utah Republican, writing, \"Very upset by this story but I have been in touch with the Utah National Guard and they are taken care of. My staff and I are investigating what happened here and will continue working to fix this situation.\"  Sen. Krysten Sinema, a Democrat from Arizona, tweeted, \"This is outrageous, shameful, and incredibly disrespectful to the men and women keeping the U.S. Capitol safe and secure. We need it fixed and we need answers on how it happened.\" One week earlier, pictures of National Guard troops resting in the Capitol rotunda also caused an uproar. A spokesperson for the Guard made clear that the troops were not sleeping on duty but were resting between shifts.    \"To be clear, this is not where they are lodging when off-duty. Being present is the first step in ensuring the safety of our citizens and our Nation's Capitol. Our security personnel work in shifts and rest when they can as others stand watch,\" a Guard spokesperson said. Most of the 25,000 National Guardsmen who were brought to Washington to help secure the city through the inauguration will be sent home within five to 10 days, the Bureau said earlier Thursday. Approximately 15,000 troops will return home \"as soon as possible,\" though the planning and process to begin moving them may take a few days. There are some agencies requesting ongoing support, the National Guard Bureau said, and approximately 7,000 guardsmen are expected to stay through the end of the month. © 2019 Cable News Network.

      "(CNN) - Americans are becoming more willing to get the coronavirus vaccine when it's available to them: About 66% say they'll try to get vaccinated, according to a CNN poll, up from 51% in October.  Here's what you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day.  (You can also get \"5 Things You Need to Know Today\" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. Coronavirus  President Biden unveiled a national strategy to get the coronavirus pandemic under control. It begins with a national vaccination campaign to administer 100 million shots during his first 100 days in office. Biden also signed executive orders to bolster pandemic response and testing capabilities, and issued a federal mask mandate for interstate travel. Dr. Anthony Fauci says he's confident the US \"can and should\" vaccinate up to 85% of the adult US population by summer's end. Meanwhile, the UK is considering closing its borders to contain Covid-19 variants and may offer money to people diagnosed with the virus as an incentive to self-isolate. And Japan insists the Tokyo Olympics will go on this summer, despite rumors of cancellation. 2. White House  More executive orders are expected to come today as Biden continues to swiftly overturn his predecessor's policies. One order focuses on raising the minimum wage to $15 for the federal workforce, and the other on expanding assistance for Americans in need. The Biden administration has its work cut out for it elsewhere, too. In coming days, the Justice Department must decide what to do with cases in which it has been expected to defend former President Trump. The White House has also ordered an intelligence review of Russian misdeeds, including the recent SolarWinds hack, at the same time it will pursue an extension of the New START Treaty, a nuclear arms control agreement with Russia that expires next month. Also on Biden's foreign policy to-do list: Figure out ways to address rising tensions with China and Iran, and deal with the growing nuclear threat out of North Korea. 3. Capitol riot Seven Senate Democrats have requested an Ethics Committee investigation of Republican Sens. Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz to find out if their objections to the Electoral College votes may have contributed to inciting the violent Capitol insurrection. So far, prosecutors have charged more than 120 people and soon may bring more serious charges, including conspiracy. As the probe moves forward, new evidence reveals rioters attacked and threatened police officers with flagpoles and fire extinguishers, hurled insults and made clear their violent intentions. Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has proposed delaying Trump's impeachment trial until mid-February to give Trump's legal team time to prepare. Trump was impeached by the House in his final days in office for his alleged role in inciting the insurrection. 4. Uganda  A growing number of international voices, including the United States, the  European Union and human rights groups, are calling for a probe into Ugandan election abuses and violence that left more than 40 people dead in the lead-up to the vote. During the election, opposition candidates were harassed, news media was suppressed by the government and observers' offices were raided, the EU Council of Ministers has said. Human Rights Watch says there were incidences of violence and human rights violations as well. Uganda's longtime leader, President Yoweri Museveni, was declared the winner for a record sixth term amid an internet blackout and allegations of abuse. His opponent, Bobi Wine, has been under house arrest since the military surrounded his home a week ago. 5. China  Twenty-two miners have been trapped underground for nearly two weeks following an explosion at a gold mine in eastern China, and officials say it could take another two weeks to get them out. At least 11 of the 22 miners -- who are trapped in different areas -- are confirmed to be alive, and most of them are getting food, medical supplies, blankets and batches of nutrient solution through a shaft. Officials say rescuers will have to drill through 70 tons of debris to reach the miners. Explosions and deaths are not uncommon in Chinese mines. In September, at least 16 workers in a coal mine died after being trapped and exposed to carbon monoxide. In 2016, a gas explosion claimed the lives of dozens of workers in another coal mine.

      "http://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_09c61e805789abbf8d7b9fbb6b3ec0bd\n",
      "(CNN) - A fire in a Washington State town has forced residents to flee the area due to the threat of a potential explosion. Local police and fire agencies are on the scene of a commercial structure fire at Washington Potato Company in Warden, Washington, according to the Grant County Sheriff's Office.     There is a \"risk of ammonia tank explosion,\" the sheriff's office said.  Warden is located about 90 miles southwest of Spokane. The population of the town is approximately 2,800, according to a recent Census Bureau estimate. It is unclear at this time the exact number of residents ordered to evacuate.  Authorities have issued a Level 3 evacuation, which means \"GO NOW\" for \"All areas west of Road U-SE and south of SR170, Warden,\" a tweet from the sheriff's office said.  \"Law enforcement officers will go door-to-door to notify persons in the Level 3 area,\" the message said.  Officials said there have been no reports of injuries so far. \"The Red Cross can provide assistance to those displaced by the #WardenFire,\" the Grant County Sheriff's Office tweeted.

      "http://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_3557001d1dca23a18ab698ded4305f55\n",
      "New Delhi, India  (CNN) - A fire that broke out at a facility of the world's biggest vaccine maker that killed five people would not affect vaccine production, the head of the company said Thursday. The blaze at the Serum Institute of India (SII) in the western city of Pune was brought under control on Thursday though the cause is still under investigation, according to Murlidhar Mohol, the city's mayor. Four people were rescued from the six-floor building but five others died, Mohol said. They are believed to have been construction workers as the building was still under construction at the time of the fire.  Videos and images showed black smoke billowing out of the building at the company's complex. Fifteen units of the municipal corporation and fire department worked to douse the fire, Mohol said.  Preliminary investigations suggest that \"during the building's construction, some welding work could have led to the fire,\" he added. Pune's fire brigade chief Prashant Ranpise said Friday that the fire started on the second floor. As firefighters worked to put out the flames, the blaze reigned in another spot. The second fire was extinguished at 4:15 p.m. local time by 50 firefighters and personnel. Ranpise said they are still investigating the cause of the fire. \"We have learnt that there has unfortunately been some loss of life at the incident. We are deeply saddened and offer our deepest condolences to the family members of the departed,\" SII CEO Adar Poonawalla tweeted Thursday.  SII, the world's biggest vaccine maker, is in partnership with Oxford University and AstraZeneca to produce the Covishield vaccine. In December, the company said it was producing 50 to 60 million doses of Covishield per month, with production to be scaled up to 100 million doses in January or February. A family business started by Poonawalla's father 50 years ago to bring cheaper vaccines to the masses, the Serum Institute of India is aiming to produce hundreds of millions of coronavirus vaccines for not only India, but also other developing countries. In a tweet, Poonawalla said that despite a \"few floors being destroyed,\" production of the Covishield vaccine would not be affected.  \"I would like to reassure all governments and the public that there would be no loss of COVISHIELD production due to multiple production buildings that I had kept in reserve to deal with such contingencies,\" he said.  Cyrus S. Poonawalla, SII's chairman and managing director, said in a statement that the fire broke out at a facility that was under constriction in the Special Economic Zone at Manjri. He said it was an \"extremely sorrowful day\" and the company would offer INR 2.5 million ($34,000) to each of the victims' families. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted his condolences Thursday: \"Anguished by the loss of lives due to an unfortunate fire ... In this sad hour, my thoughts are with the families of those who lost their lives. I pray that those injured recover at the earliest.\" © 2019 Cable News Network. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.

      "26 The Kamala Harris you don't know\n",
      "http://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_c947fa8b2bd17386907462250e4d7167\n",
      "Editor's Note: Dan Morain is a journalist from California and author of a new biography of Kamala Harris, \"Kamala's Way, An American Life.\" The opinions expressed here are those of the author. View more opinion articles on CNN. (CNN) - On Wednesday, Kamala Harris became the 49th vice president of the United States, the first woman, first Black and first South Asian person to hold that office.    Since Harris announced her presidential bid in early 2019, she was met with pushback and reservations from progressives in the country due to her law enforcement record. People on the right view her as leftist. Some on the left see her as not progressive enough. She is, on some levels, a work in progress and, no doubt, will fall short of some people's expectations. But as her biographer, I'm here to tell you there's much more to Kamala Harris than meets the eye.    When she became California attorney general at the start of 2011, Kamala Harris made clear that she had big plans for herself. Harris announced that former US secretaries of state Warren Christopher and George Shultz would co-chair the team leading her transition to an office with no discernible foreign policy portfolio. It was too easy for me, then a political affairs columnist for the Sacramento Bee, to be snarky. I wrote that Harris either was aiming for higher office or would have \"the best darned foreign policy of any attorney general in America.\"    I was right that Harris was a woman in a hurry. But what I didn't know then, and what I have learned since in writing her biography, is that she knew the virtue of staying out of the spotlight and avoiding making ill-timed power grabs that could undermine her goal.    Perhaps, most importantly, I found that she is willing to take time out of her busy schedule to commit acts of empathy, even when there is nothing in it for her. As I wrote her biography, the examples of her character and style abounded.  Fighting sexual exploitation There is, for instance, her work to end human trafficking. Harris had seen the ugly side of the issue when she worked as a prosecutor in Oakland and San Francisco. She used her position as California attorney general to elevate the issue.   \"Human trafficking is a modern form of slavery,\" the Harris-led California Department of Justice said in a report on human trafficking in California, back in 2012. The report pointed out that in the internet age, \"the business of sex trafficking, in particular, has moved online,\" and singled out \"unscrupulous websites like Backpage.com,\" a classified ad website that was a bazaar for prostitution, with revenue exceeding hundreds of millions of dollars a year, Justice Department authorities allege.    Harris and other state attorneys general were especially concerned that Backpage was being used to traffic minors. That's why in 2013, they signed a letter to four Congress members pointing out that the federal Communications Decency Act precluded state law enforcement authorities from carrying out their duty \"to investigate and prosecute those who promote prostitution and endanger our children,\" and urging that the law be changed.   The Communications Decency Act, signed by President Bill Clinton in 1996, served to shield social media companies from liability for what people post on their sites. The law helped transform companies such as Twitter and Facebook into internet behemoths. That immunity is fundamental to their business model. Backpage also sought to hide behind that same protection.   Despite the requests from state attorneys general in 2013, Congress failed to act. So, starting in 2013, one of Harris' deputies, Maggy Krell, embarked on an investigation into Backpage that found several minors who had been pimped using ads from the site.   Three years later, in 2016, with Attorney General Harris' backing, Krell filed charges against the creators and CEO of Backpage.com, accusing them of a form of pimping. The case also would test the boundaries of state law.   The criminal complaint and an arrest warrant were filed under seal at the end of September 2016, and, with the help of Texas authorities, agents searched Backpage's offices in Dallas.    On Oct. 6, 2016, a little more than a month before Harris would face voters in her run for the US Senate, California unsealed the complaint. Some of Harris's critics claimed she filed the case to win votes, although the outcome of the race was not in doubt. She had large leads in polling throughout the campaign.    Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, whose agents helped California authorities, held a news conference announcing details of the case. Harris issued a news release but did not hold a news conference. She rarely held news conferences after arrests, and she did not parade defendants before cameras in perp walks.    Two years later, when Harris was long gone from Sacramento, federal authorities shut down the site and brought criminal charges against several of its executives. Backpage was no more, in no small part because the investigation began when she was California's attorney general. She held no news conference to commemorate its demise.  Focusing on those in need In 2016, when Harris was running for the Senate and Donald Trump was running for President, Trump's so-called university had become the focus of lawsuits by the New York attorney general and by private attorneys representing students who claimed they were victims of fraud.    Harris's opponent, Loretta Sanchez, a fellow Democrat who was then a member of Congress, criticized Harris for failing to sue Trump's school, saying her reticence could have been tied to $6,000 in campaign donations she had received from Trump early in her tenure as California attorney general.   Perhaps, Harris could have joined the New York attorney general's lawsuit against Trump. She definitely would have scored points with California voters, given their dim view of Trump.    But she declined to sue Trump University, and there were sound reasons for that decision. One of Attorney General Harris's former aides who was involved in the decision making told me that relatively few Californians were victims of the Trump University scam. People who fell for Trump's bluster were out some money but weren't made destitute. And resources are finite.    Instead, under Harris, the state sued Corinthian Colleges, Inc., a California-based corporation that affected far more people in the state. In its suit, the state alleged that Corinthian, operating under various names, advertised heavily on daytime television, targeting people who had ''low self-esteem.\" The state alleged that many Corinthian students received degrees of little value and were left with huge student loan debt. The state ultimately won a $1.1 billion judgment against the company and pushed for forgiveness on the debt Corinthian students amassed. Instead of the headlines a Trump suit would have got her, she focused on the mass of California students in need.  Leading with humanity Harris can be tough on her staff, and harsh when, as a US senator, she questioned Trump administration officials and nominees. But what I also discovered is that when cameras weren't around, she displayed a more human side.   Matthew Davis, a friend from law school, recalled the time he called Harris, then San Francisco district attorney, to encourage her to write a note to an old woman, Naomi Gray, who was nearing the end of her life at a nursing home. Gray had supported Harris and was overjoyed that she had won the seat. Harris had a better idea. She dropped what she was doing, went to the nursing home, and spent 20 minutes holding the woman's hand and comforting her. The woman died a few days later.    I found many other examples like that, including the time, days before the 2018 midterms, when Harris learned that one of her aides, Tyrone Gayle, was nearing death from colon cancer. She put her political duties on hold and got onto a flight from Washington to New York, so she could hold his hand one last time.    Vice President Harris has a record of winning, of being strategic, and keeping her eye on the prize. Perhaps most important of all, she has a heart. She shares that attribute with President Biden. If the nation is to heal from the divisiveness of the past four years, and of the weeks since November 3, having a vice president who mixes toughness and determination with empathy ought to give us reason for hope. © 2019 Cable News Network.

      "27 Donald Trump has a money problem\n",
      "http://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_d2ff109392815413e9d92aae4a567496\n",
      "(CNN) - Just 24 hours after Donald Trump formally left the White House -- and the presidency -- behind, it's increasingly clear that his money problems are getting worse, not better. According to financial disclosure documents released in the hours after Trump left the White House to fly to his new home in Florida, the ex-President's eponymous company took a major revenue hit over the last year. Overall, Trump's businesses produced almost 40% less revenue in 2020 versus 2019. He made $30 million less at his Doral property in Miami than he did in 2019. Revenue at the Trump International Hotel in Washington and the former President's Turnberry property in Scotland were down more than 60% year over year. And, as CNN's Charles Riley notes, those downturns came even before a series of companies cut ties following Trump's role in the incitement of rioters who stormed the US Capitol on January 6. While some -- maybe much? -- of the downturn in Trump's financial fortunes can be laid at the feet of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and the societal restrictions it has forced on all of the travel and hospitality industry, the \"why\" of Trump's falling fortune matters far less than the \"what now.\" You'll remember -- and, if not, I am here to remind you -- that Trump faces a series of financial challenges in the coming months and years, primarily tied to his personal guarantees on a series of multimillion dollar loans. As The New York Times' David Leonhardt wrote of Trump's tax returns in late 2020: \"He appears to be responsible for loans totaling $421 million, most of which is coming due within four years. \"Should he win re-election, his lenders could be placed in the unprecedented position of weighing whether to foreclose on a sitting president. Whether he wins or loses, he will probably need to find new ways to use his brand — and his popularity among tens of millions of Americans — to make money.\" So, Trump didn't win reelection. And not only that but, on his way out the door, he peddled a series of lies about the 2020 election that played a not-insignificant part in a riot on January 6 that led to the violent storming of the US Capitol and triggered his second impeachment by the House. All of which is likely to even further complicate Trump's ability to a) make money and b) pay off his looming debts. The Point: For all of the talk about Trump's next political moves, it's his dicey financial future that is likely his focus now that he is out of office. © 2019 Cable News Network.

      "28 Start of Trump's impeachment trial remains unsettled\n",
      "http://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_43390e05df030162ab62462864192c83\n",
      "(CNN) - The timing of former President Donald Trump's Senate impeachment trial is still unsettled while Senate leaders haggle over how a power-sharing agreement will govern a 50-50 Senate. The question of who will represent Trump remains unanswered. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said at a news conference Thursday that the House was \"ready\" to begin the trial but would wait until the Senate was prepared before formally transmitting the impeachment article, the step that would begin the trial the following day. \"They have now informed us they are ready to receive, the question is other questions about how a trial will proceed, but we are ready,\" Pelosi said of the Senate. House Democrats are in discussions to send over the article of impeachment to the Senate as early as Friday, two sources say, but a complicating factor remains the fact that Trump still does not have a lawyer to represent him in a Senate trial. \"The articles could be walked over Friday,\" one source told CNN. There are also discussions about how to ensure a trial can move quickly and not overwhelm President Joe Biden's agenda, but ultimately no timing has been finalized. Trump's lack of lawyers underscores the chaos that the former President is still injecting on Capitol Hill even after he left Washington on Wednesday before Biden's inauguration.

      "29 Impeachment trial hangs over Biden's first days in office\n",
      "http://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_6dfe740395e32e7771591a98cde46c8f\n",
      "Washington  (CNN) - President Joe Biden is calling for unity, but with an impeachment trial of an ex-President around the corner, a long list of nominations still to be confirmed in the US Senate and Republicans already casting doubt on the need for another massive Covid-19 relief package, don't expect the mirage of bipartisanship to last long.  Biden's agenda isn't going to sail through the narrowly-held Democratic Senate. In the House, the new President will have to contend with competing factions for moderates and progressives who each believe they've been handed a mandate to govern. Bottom line: The Biden team is just getting started and the US Senate is still getting organized. There's a lot of wrinkles to iron out in the days ahead, and the goodwill isn't going to last long, especially once lawmakers are confined to their desks starting at 12 p.m. ET every day dealing with an impeachment trial. Important to watch Thursday: All eyes are on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and what she does with the articles. She has a news conference scheduled for 10:45 a.m. The pending trial The reality is no one knows yet how long this trial is going to be. Talks are ongoing. Democrats will hold their normal caucus call Thursday to talk about this. As CNN reported on Wednesday night, the aim is to move this trial along quickly. No one wants this hanging over Biden's agenda for the next month.  An expedited trial? Sure. But a reminder that it will still take a majority of senators voting to move to a vote on conviction to end this. That means rank-and-file members have to be satisfied that the trial has been long enough to be fair. Likely, leaders will have a goal in mind when they start, but they need a majority of the Senate to decide they've had enough. Democratic members are fully aware that they are setting a precedent here. If they move too fast in the name of trying to get to Biden's agenda, they risk setting a standard that a president (or ex-president) can be convicted in a matter of days. As one Democratic source close to this process told CNN on Thursday morning \"anything is possible, but people are just throwing things out there.\" Last week, the source said \"people were floating a three-month trial.\" Pelosi's plan Pelosi has kept her plans on when exactly she will transmit the article of impeachment to the Senate extremely close. But, as CNN's Manu Raju reported on Wednesday night, there is talks she could transmit them soon and potentially the Senate could begin some of the ceremonial aspects of an impeachment trial as soon as Friday. For the last several days, the House impeachment managers have been working through their arguments and how they plan to lay out their case, but it's important to consider that we still don't know. GOP factions Some Republicans are ready to move on. Others want to hold former President Donald Trump accountable and the well-respected Republican leader Mitch McConnell isn't revealing to his colleagues if he'll vote to convict Trump.   CNN's Raju and Ted Barrett's story on Wednesday night captured the tension perfectly. Republicans are sending out a warning to McConnell that if he votes to convict Trump, there will be a price to pay.  Already, you've seen members of the House Freedom Caucus trying to oust their No. 3 GOP Leader Liz Cheney, a Republican from Wyoming, for voting to impeach Trump in the House. Those efforts are a long shot. But, the intraparty schism right now is real as Republicans sort out what the party is without Trump at the top of the ticket.  You are seeing Republicans approach impeachment with three separate views. You have a small number of Republicans who have signaled  that they think the country cannot move on without holding Trump accountable. You have some Trump allies continuing to stand by him and a growing number of Republicans who don't condone the Trump's actions on January 6, but are arguing that moving ahead with an impeachment trial of an ex-president is a fruitless, damaging process. You even have some Republicans arguing it's not constitutional at all to impeach an ex-president. Republicans are expected to talk Thursday about this on a regularly scheduled conference call. Biden's agenda Yes, Biden has plans for another economic relief package and a massive overhaul of the country's immigration plan. But, those items aren't simply going to be picked up and passed without changes.  Aides and Democratic members CNN is talking to warn that Biden's plans are good starts, but there are items that progressives and moderates want to see added and subtracted. A new Democratic administration means that Democrats believe they have a real shot at finally getting some of their agenda items through.  As always, the complication comes when members begin really digging into these proposals and laying out their wishes. This is when some of the cracks that exist between what the progressives in the party and what the moderates in the party begin to show themselves.  Biden's team is well aware of how legislating works. It's why you have seen the transition hosting policy briefs with various factions of the House Democratic caucus. It's why you see a group of 16 bipartisan senators planning to meet in the next several days with Biden's Director of the National Economic Council Brian Deese.  But all you have to do is look at how many messages were coming out on immigration on Wednesday to understand that Biden's legislative proposals are just starting points. You had Sen. Dick Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois, talking on the floor about passing the DREAM Act, a more narrow proposal than the one Biden's team has laid out. And Sen. Bob Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey, suggesting that there was still more work to do to try and reach out to Republicans and get some of them on board.   On power sharing The Senate hasn't officially passed their organizing resolution yet that establishes how many members are on each committee and how McConnell and Senate Democratic leader Schumer plan to run the 50-50 Senate.   Democrats earlier this week thought they were being generous offering McConnell essential a mirror of the 2001 agreement between Trent Lott and Tom Daschle that split committees evenly and allowed Republicans and Democrats to preside over the Senate.  The sticking point is still over the filibuster and McConnell's insistence that the organizing resolution includes some language to enshrine it. But progressive Democrats are making it clear to Schumer that he shouldn't cave on this even though it's unlikely Schumer would ever have the votes to do-away with the filibuster given that he'd need every one of his members to agree to it. It's putting Schumer in a tough position. In other words, this is adding even more complication to getting Biden's nominees through and voted on. © 2019 Cable News Network.

      "30 How the narrow Senate majority will shape Biden's presidency\n",
      "http://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_d69b97dc2bb3de393a7c975d5b12339a\n",
      "Washington  (CNN) - In a matter of hours, President Joe Biden will inherit a Democratic-controlled House of Representatives and Senate. But the narrow majorities in both chambers will challenge his administration's agenda, his timeline and the goal Biden set to restore unity in the country after four years of tumult under President Donald Trump. Bottom line: When Biden is sworn in Wednesday, we still may not know some of the basic tenets of how the Capitol will function during his first two years. There still is not an organizing resolution laying out the rules that will govern the 50-50 Senate over the next two years. We still have no official word on when there will be an impeachment trial, and the fight over fast-tracking Biden's nominees has already begun. Big picture: A normal pace isn't coming anytime soon. Sources have repeatedly told CNN that the next days and weeks will test both parties and the institutions they inhabit. Fights over the constitutionality of impeaching an ex-President are already beginning. Slow-walking Biden's nominees is already underway. And besides the daily business of governing, each party is reckoning with its future. Republicans must recalibrate and decide what their party stands for in the wake of Trump. Democrats -- now finally in power -- must decide how hard they want to push the agenda of their base all the while being governed by a President who has always valued compromise. When does the change happen? In a matter of hours, the US Senate will change hands. After Biden is sworn in at 12 p.m. ET, three new Democratic US senators will be sworn in at 4:30 p.m., officially cementing a shift in power in the chamber. There is no big vote or ceremonial changing of the guard. Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York will become the majority leader. Sen. Pat Leahy, a Democrat from Vermont, will become the President Pro Tempore. Biden's nominees face Senate slog Nominations won't necessarily be easy. Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley made it clear on Tuesday that he would slow walk the nomination of Biden's Homeland Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, a potential sign that Biden's fight for even his security-related nominations is going to be hard-fought. In his statement, Hawley said his reason was because Mayorkas had not \"adequately explained how he will enforce federal law and secure the southern border given President-elect Biden's promise to roll back major enforcement and security measures.\" So far, no other senator has come out publicly saying they'll stand in the way of Biden's nominees on other key agencies like Defense, Treasury or State or director of national intelligence. The tone and tenor of those nomination hearings on Thursday made it clear that it's likely those nominations will move more quickly. But we still don't have official word that any of those nominations are moving on Wednesday, either.  On Thursday, the House will vote on a waiver for Lloyd Austin's nomination for defense secretary, a process that will just add a day or two to his potential confirmation. Hawley's move underscores the reality that any member can disrupt -- or at least delay -- Biden's agenda, and with a handful of Republican senators training their eyes on running for President in 2024, expect these moments to come around from time to time. The organizing resolution Schumer and current Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell met on Tuesday to iron out the organizing resolution for the next Senate. Schumer offered McConnell a resolution that looked almost identical to the one from 2001 between Republican Trent Lott and Democrat Tom Daschle that split committee membership and budgets, established a protocol for how to get things out of committee when they were stuck due to a tie and allowed members of both parties to preside over the chamber. McConnell wants to cement another change: a promise to keep the legislative filibuster. Practically speaking, the filibuster isn't going anywhere with or without the organizing resolution. With a narrow majority, Schumer would have to have all of his members and Vice President Kamala Harris breaking the tie to \"go nuclear.\" We know from comments by moderates like Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia who is opposed to eradicating the filibuster, that Schumer wouldn't have the votes for that.  Still, it's a strategic move on McConnell's part and a way to enshrine minority rights. Putting it in the organizing resolution would also start Schumer out in a difficult spot with his base. It would set a precedent for future organizing resolutions and make it harder for Democrats to do away with the 60-vote threshold on legislation. As with all of these negotiations, remember that staff is still working through this. Just because McConnell and Schumer don't sit down in a room to hammer this out doesn't mean negotiations aren't ongoing. Impeachment The timeline for a trial hasn't materialized since the House voted a week ago to impeach Trump for a second time. On Wednesday, Democrats want to make this moment about Joe Biden. Don't expect any announcements. Aides and members we are talking to have made it clear that nothing on the timing of an impeachment trial is expected to be worked out until Schumer and McConnell hammer out their organizing resolution. And Democrats would also like to ensure that at least some of Biden's nominees are confirmed before they lock themselves into a static schedule that comes with the trappings of a trial.  Ultimately, this is still House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's call, but if anyone understands a political moment, it's her. The extent to which members and aides tell me they are in the dark about what comes next is extraordinary for a town where people like to talk. The effort has clearly been made to make this day and week about Biden and not about the impeachment of the last President. Complicating the timeline for a trial is the fact that Republicans are sending signals that they aren't likely to agree to let Biden fast-track nominees in the morning before a Senate trial begins every day at 12 p.m. Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican and member of leadership, told reporters on Tuesday that dual tracking the day \"is not going to be possible.\" \"It's Nancy Pelosi's choice because once she sends the article of impeachment over, it displaces all other business,\" Cornyn said. \"If she wants to delay the confirmation of President Biden's nominees to Cabinet positions and prevent President Biden from asking for and receiving additional Covid-19 relief, that would be one way to do it, so they have a big decision to make.\" © 2019 Cable News Network.

      "31 'A vote of conscience': GOP senators signal that Trump's fate is in their hands\n",
      "http://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_b781b1398e50fe3f1e7cfd2418f0df31\n",
      "(CNN) - A wide range of Senate Republicans are noncommittal about whether they are considering convicting Donald Trump of committing high crimes and misdemeanors at his upcoming impeachment trial, a sign that the soon-to-be former President's political future rests squarely with his fellow Republicans who are weighing whether to hold him accountable for the deadly riot in the Capitol this month. As the Senate reconvened Tuesday for the first time since the pro-Trump mob ransacked the Capitol on January 6, a number of top Republicans pointedly refused to say if they'd consider convicting Trump for his role in inciting the crowd, trying to subvert the will of voters and lying for months about widespread fraud in the elections. Yet an outspoken faction of their colleagues warned their party not to take such a drastic step of forbidding Trump from ever holding office again, while other Republicans contended that convicting a former President would be unconstitutional, giving them a way to argue for acquittal while also criticizing Trump's conduct. In interviews, several Republicans claimed they were keeping an open mind -- a sign that it remains far too early to know whether 17 Republicans would break ranks and join 50 Democrats to convict Trump of inciting an insurrection. How Republicans ultimately vote will come down to a mix of factors: The strength of the case brought by House Democrats, how the President's team mounts its defense and, perhaps most importantly, the mood of the country at the moment it comes time to cast the decisive votes. \"I've heard people talk about a vote of conscience, and I think that's a good way to put it,\" Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican and member of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's leadership team, told reporters on Tuesday. The GOP positioning is another indication that Republican senators' posture toward Trump's second impeachment is markedly different than last year's trial, when virtually all GOP senators steadfastly aligned themselves with the President after the House impeached him over charges of abusing power and obstructing Congress. This time, though, many GOP senators are disgusted at Trump's conduct as he cast doubt about the election results and fed lies to his supporters that Biden didn't actually win, ultimately leading to the pro-Trump mob that overran the Capitol as Congress was certifying Biden's electoral victory. There's wide expectation that the vote to convict will almost certainly be a bipartisan one and could very likely gain more than the support of just Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, the lone Republican who voted to convict Trump on the abuse of power charge in 2020, but who says he's undecided now. Still, getting to 17 Republican defectors remains an open question. South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the GOP whip who was critical of the doomed efforts by Trump allies to overturn the election in Congress, has been viewed as a potential swing vote. On Tuesday, Thune, who is up for reelection next year and is close to McConnell, punted when asked if the President committed impeachable offenses.   \"It sounds like we're going to have a trial to examine that, and like all senators, I'll fulfill my constitutional duty and listen intently to the evidence, and we will come to the conclusion,\" Thune said. Others took similar positions. Sen. Todd Young, an Indiana Republican up for reelection next year, told CNN that he would \"do his duty\"  but refused to cast judgment on Trump's actions. \"I'm focused on the very near term, which is a peaceful transition of power,\" Young said. \"I just spent a week traveling around the state of Indiana. That's really what's on people's minds. They were rattled, to put it mildly, by the events of January 6, and I've done my best to be part of the near-term healing and rebuilding of trust, and in trying to help people process that.\"   McConnell, who has privately indicated he thinks Trump committed impeachable offenses but said he would listen to the arguments in the impeachment trial before settling on a decision, set the tone on Tuesday when he pointedly blamed Trump for playing a key role in inciting the mob. \"The mob was fed lies,\" McConnell said on the Senate floor. \"They were provoked by the President and other powerful people. And they tried to use fear and violence to stop a specific proceeding of the first branch of the federal government which they did not like. But we pressed on.\" The Senate's second impeachment trial for Trump, which could begin within days, will force Republicans to go on the record one more time about how they view the outgoing President. If 67 senators convict Trump, they then could vote to bar him from running for office again by a simple majority of senators. GOP senators close to Trump are warning that such as vote could backfire on the GOP, where Trump still holds significant sway among the base. \"It will destroy the party,\" Graham predicted when asked about a successful vote to convict Trump. \"The Republican Party wants to move forward.\" Congressional aides and senators have spent the past several days digging into the question about whether the impeachment trial is constitutional, with many concluding that there are arguments to make the case on either side. A number of other Republicans are making a constitutional case against the trial itself. That argument -- that the proceedings are unconstitutional -- could give GOP senators a way to argue that the President's conduct was improper without casting a politically tough vote to convict him. \"Why are we doing this when the President is out of office?\" asked Iowa GOP Sen. Joni Ernst, who said Tuesday she didn't think it was constitutional. \"I have read arguments on both sides, but he is not our President after tomorrow.\" The House Democratic impeachment managers -- and many other constitutional scholars -- argue that it's constitutional to move forward with an impeachment trial of a former President. While it would be unprecedented for the Senate to convict an ex-president, they point to precedent where the Senate has asserted it has the constitutional right to try former federal officers.    \"We need to set a precedent that the severest offense ever committed by a President will be met by the severest remedy provided by the Constitution,\" Schumer said Tuesday. \"Impeachment and conviction by this chamber as well as disbarment from future office.\" For members up for reelection in 2022, the question of convicting Trump becomes even harder. Many members are running in states that Trump won. And some of those members have made it clear that they will weigh conviction with the question of what is best for uniting the country. \"My answer to anything that doesn't relate to the inauguration is I'll talk to you after the inauguration,\" said Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, a Republican who is playing a central role in preparing for the Wednesday event but who also faces voters next year. And some of Trump's Hill allies wouldn't lay out their thinking on Tuesday. \"I got to wait 'til I hear the evidence,\" Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, the most senior Senate Republican, said Tuesday when asked if he thinks Trump committed impeachable offenses. The timing of the Senate trial remains in flux, as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has yet to send the article of impeachment to the Senate. The impending trial gives Republicans some control over delaying Biden's agenda, if they choose to. While Democrats will control the Senate after Wednesday, Republicans can slow down the Senate so that it cannot conduct an impeachment trial and confirm Biden's nominees at the same time.   On Tuesday, Cornyn told reporters that he did not believe Republicans would be agreeing to divide the days in half so that the Senate could approve Biden's Cabinet nominees in the morning and then move to an impeachment trial each afternoon. Doing so would require 100 senators to agree, which, Cornyn said, \"is not going to be possible.\" \"It's Nancy Pelosi's choice because once she sends the article of impeachment over, it displaces all other business,\" Cornyn said. \"If she wants to delay the confirmation of President Biden's nominees to Cabinet positions and prevent President Biden from asking for and receiving additional Covid-19 relief, that would be one way to do it, so they have a big decision to make.\"   With so much uncertainty ahead, even some Republicans viewed as likely to convict have refused to show their hands. \"I'm going to wait and see the evidence as it's presented,\" Romney told CNN.  © 2019 Cable News Network.

      "32 11 false claims Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has tweeted in the last month\n",
      "http://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_71b7344e3d0e5a5dcfad62c7da5cd680\n",
      "Washington  (CNN) - A rookie Republican congresswoman from Georgia, Marjorie Taylor Greene, was suspended from Twitter on Sunday for 12 hours after she repeatedly tweeted election misinformation.  Greene has a long history of embracing baseless conspiracy theories. And she has been a serial tweeter of false claims -- about the election, the Capitol insurrection and other subjects -- since she won her seat in November. Below is a fact check of 11 false claims Greene has tweeted in the last month alone, including three related claims about the integrity of the election. After CNN emailed her congressional office to offer her the opportunity to comment on any of these findings, her communications director, Nick Dyer, had only a brief response, \"Here's our comment: 'CNN is fake news.'\" The insurrection timeline Defending President Donald Trump against accusations that he incited the Capitol insurrection, Greene argued: \"The timeline doesn't fit the narrative. Trump supporters could not have listened to President Trump's speech at the WH and then been 'incited' by him to walk to and attack the Capitol.\" Facts First: This is just not true -- even leaving aside the fact that insurrectionists near the Capitol could have listened to Trump's speech on their phones or could have been inspired by Trump's previous rhetoric. There was more than enough time for people to walk about a mile and a half from The Ellipse park, where Trump gave a speech that ended before 1:15 p.m. ET, to the Capitol, where rioters were still present more than three hours after Trump concluded. In fact, the FBI alleges that some insurrection participants did make this walk, including one who allegedly went from the Trump speech to her hotel and then into the Capitol. White supremacists and the insurrection Abortion rights group NARAL Pro-Choice America tweeted the following about the insurrection: \"Anti-choice extremists, white supremacists, and violent misogynists all converged this week to attack our country. But the thing is, these groups already have a lot of overlap. What we saw was horrifying and devastating. But it wasn't surprising.\" Greene responded that the Capitol attack was \"terrible and shouldn't have happened\" -- but then added that all of the people who died as a result of the insurrection were White, \"so I'm not sure where your white supremacy bs is coming from.\" Facts First: According to the FBI, it is true, not \"bs,\" that White supremacists were involved in the insurrection. (Also, the fact that people killed at the Capitol were White obviously does not mean White supremacists could not have been among the perpetrators. Some of the people killed had been participants in the insurrection. And White supremacists sometimes kill other White people.) The FBI alleges that Bryan Betancur, who has been charged for alleged involvement in the insurrection, is \"is a self-professed White supremacist who has made statements to law enforcement officers that he is a member of several white supremacy organizations.\" The FBI alleges that a confidential source says that another man who has been charged, Timothy Louis Hale-Cusanelli, is \"an avowed white supremacist and Nazi sympathizer.\" A third man who has been charged, Robert Keith Packer, is alleged to be the man seen at the insurrection wearing a \"Camp Auschwitz\" shirt. The FBI alleges the shirt \"appears to be a symbol of Nazi hate ideology.\"  A fourth man who has been charged, Anthime Joseph (Tim) Gionet, is an Internet personality who is known for his role in the racist and anti-Semitic \"alt-right\" movement and who attended the infamous White nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017. The charges against these men were announced after Greene's \"bs\" tweet, but nonetheless, there was never any basis to accuse NARAL of making up the claim that white supremacists were present at the Capitol. In addition, a variety of symbols used by white supremacists had been seen at the Capitol during the insurrection.  The publication Insider has reported that Gionet has disputed the assertion that he is a white nationalist. Packer did not respond to CNN requests for comment before his arrest. Betancur and Hale-Cusanelli did not immediately have lawyers listed in an online federal system.  Voter fraud Greene tweeted that \"there was MASS voter fraud on a scale that should terrify every American regardless of political party.\" Facts First: This is, again, just false. There is no evidence of mass voter fraud -- as Republican election officials around the country and Trump-appointed former Attorney General William Barr have acknowledged. Rather, there have been isolated instances of alleged fraud by lone voters, far too minor to have affected the outcome. In court, even Trump's own legal team often declined to allege mass fraud -- focusing instead on complaints about law and process. But the Trump team lost case after case anyway.  The integrity of the election We'll address three related claims under this one heading. Greene repeatedly called the presidential election \"stolen.\" She repeatedly referred to some of President-elect Joe Biden's electoral votes as \"fraudulent.\" And she explicitly claimed that Biden \"lost\" the election and Trump \"won.\"  Facts First: All three claims are false. Biden won the election, fairly and legally. There is no evidence to suggest otherwise. Trump's various claims about supposed fraud and supposed election-rigging have been rejected in court and debunked at length by officials and fact checkers.  The presidential election in Georgia Greene criticized Gabriel Sterling, a senior official in the office of Georgia's top elections official, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. She tweeted, \"You ran a Nov 3rd election that was stolen bc you idiots at the SOS mailed out millions of absentee ballots to any one and everyone while GA was an open state.\" Facts First: Georgia's presidential election was not \"stolen.\" Biden won the state fair and square, as confirmed by three counts of the ballots and an audit of some voters' signatures.  Georgia was not one of the states to send an absentee ballot to every eligible registered voter; a ballot was only sent to an eligible voter who requested one. Georgia does not require any excuse to vote absentee, but this no-excuse policy was created by state Republican leaders in 2005, not by Raffensperger himself.  The Senate elections in Georgia Greene tweeted: \"... Georgia state leaders refused to listen to Georgia tax payers. They refused to change anything after allowing @realDonaldTrump's election to be stolen. And they refused to #StopTheSteaI with our two senate seats.\" Facts First: There was no \"steal\" of Georgia's two Senate seats; Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock won fair and square in the January runoff elections. Their Republican opponents, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, have both conceded defeat.   The presidential election in Pennsylvania Greene tweeted, \"202,377 more votes cast than voters voting in Pennsylvania! This is called election fraud.\"  Facts First: False again. State officials and fact checkers have repeatedly explained that the claim that Pennsylvania had more votes than registered voters is just not true; Greene was invoking an incorrect figure from a Republican state legislator who had relied on incomplete data. The First Amendment The day after Twitter banned Trump's @realDonaldTrump account, Greene tweeted, \"Yesterday they crushed the First Amendment. You can see what's coming next. I vow to do everything I can to protect American's Second Amendment rights.\" Facts First: Nobody crushed the First Amendment on January 8. Greene didn't explicitly say she was talking about Twitter's decision to suspend Trump's account, but if she was, she was clearly inaccurate. The First Amendment prohibits the government from silencing citizens, but it does not require corporations, including social media companies like Twitter, to allow citizens to speak freely. Violence in 2020 Greene tweeted, \"ZERO Democrats have condemned the political violence of BLM/Antifa terrorists that lasted the entirety of 2020. Instead, each of them fanned the flames of hate.\" Facts First: Numerous Democrats -- including Biden, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and senior members of the party's congressional caucus -- condemned rioting and looting last year while also supporting peaceful Black Lives Matter protests against racism and police brutality. Republicans are entitled to argue that Democrats should have issued such condemnations more forcefully or frequently, or that they should have been more explicit in identifying the perpetrators, but it's just inaccurate to say or suggest they didn't issue the condemnations at all. © 2019 Cable News Network.

      "33 Canada's governor general steps down after employees accuse her of creating a 'toxic' workplace\n",
      "http://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_71adf778f6eab5da4d581b266d0725d6\n",
      "Ottawa  (CNN) - Julie Payette, a former Canadian astronaut and the country's governor general since 2017, announced she would step down Thursday after she was accused by current and former employees of creating a \"toxic\" workplace environment. In a detailed statement, Payette said that she took the allegations seriously -- although she did not formally apologize or admit to any misconduct in the workplace. \"While no formal complaints or official grievances were made during my tenure, which would have immediately triggered a detailed investigation as prescribed by law and the collective agreements in place, I still take these allegations very seriously,\"  Payette said in the statement. As first reported by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) last year, current and former government employees accused Payette of creating a toxic workplace, harassing and bullying employees and reducing some employees to tears. In response, the Trudeau government hired an independent consulting company to investigate the allegations. The report was completed and submitted to the government earlier this week and that prompted Payette's resignation. \"I am a strong believer in the principles of natural justice, due process and the rule of law, and that these principles apply to all equally,\" Payette wrote. \"Notwithstanding, in respect for the integrity of my vice-regal Office and for the good of our country and of our democratic institutions, I have come to the conclusion that a new Governor General should be appointed. Canadians deserve stability in these uncertain times.\" Canada's prime minister released his own statement Thursday, saying he had received Payette's resignation. Trudeau did not confirm any of the allegations leveled at Payette. However, in the brief statement, he did not thank her for her service. \"Every employee in the Government of Canada has the right to work in a safe and healthy environment, and we will always take this very seriously,\" Trudeau said in a statement. \"Today's announcement provides an opportunity for new leadership at Rideau Hall to address the workplace concerns raised by employees during the review.\" Trudeau said Canada's chief justice will fulfill the duties of governor on an interim basis until he makes a recommendation on a replacement to Queen Elizabeth. Had Payette not agreed to resign in light of the workplace investigation, dismissing her could have triggered a constitutional crisis in Canada, and would have mandated more formal involvement by the Queen. Government officials told CNN that the report provided by the independent investigators found the allegations were consistent among employees and the evidence of a toxic workplace was \"robust.\" It is not clear whether the results of the workplace investigation will be made public. Payette said in her statement of resignation that, \"Everyone has a right to a healthy and safe work environment, at all times and under all circumstances. It appears this was not always the case at the Office of the Secretary to the Governor General. Tensions have arisen at Rideau Hall over the past few months and for that, I am sorry.\" However, later in the statement she added, \"We all experience things differently, but we should always strive to do better, and be attentive to one another's perceptions.\" That appeared to echo similar language used by Trudeau. In 2018, CNN reported that in response to allegations that he had inappropriately groped a woman in 2000, Trudeau said during a press briefing that, \"I do not feel that I acted inappropriately in any way but I respect the fact that someone else might have experienced that differently.\" Canada's prime minister is tasked with recommending a candidate for governor general for appointment by Queen Elizabeth. In 2017 when he recommended Payette, Trudeau said she was \"unquestionably qualified for this high office.\" But Canada's opposition leader, Erin O'Toole, accused the prime minister's office of not vetting Payette thoroughly for the job. He said all political parties should now have a say in who replaces Payette. \"The Governor General is the Commander in Chief of our Armed Forces and has an important constitutional role,\" O'Toole said in a statement to CNN. \"Considering the problems with his last appointment and the minority Parliament, the Prime Minister should consult opposition parties and re-establish the Vice-Regal Appointments Committee.\" © 2019 Cable News Network.

      "34 Rescue operation to free Chinese miners trapped underground for nearly 2 weeks could take another 15 days \n",
      "http://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_ba5282314eeda3ecc70ece2d4f41f907\n",
      "(CNN) - Chinese officials say it could day 15 days to drill through 70 tons of debris to reach miners trapped underground for nearly two weeks after an explosion at a gold mine in eastern China.  Twenty-two miners were left trapped at least 600 meters (2,000 feet) underground following the blast on January 10 in the city of Qixia in Shandong Province. Eleven miners were confirmed to be alive on Sunday after rescue workers were able to drill a channel into a section the mine and install a telephone line, according to Chinese state news agency Xinhua.  One miner is believed to be dead after sustaining a head injury in the explosion, state media said. Ten people are stuck in a chamber of the gold mine 600 meters (2,000 feet) from the entrance and are in contact with rescue teams. One miner is believed to be trapped in another section, while the fate and whereabouts of 10 others is unknown. Efforts have been underway to reach the workers since the blast occurred about 240 meters (800 feet) from the mine's entrance. Food, medical supplies, blankets, and batches of nutrient solution have been passed down a shaft to the 10 workers, who have shown a \"gradual improvement\" in their physical condition, according to rescue workers cited by Xinhua.  According to state media, rescue teams are hoping to pull the miners out through a 711-millimeter (28-inch) diameter passage. By noon Thursday, rescuers had drilled 18 meters into the mineshaft but heavy debris could slow efforts. Gong Haitao, deputy head of Yantai's publicity department, said at a press conference Thursday the mineshaft is blocked 350 to 446 meters (1,100 to 1,400 feet) below the surface by 70 tons of debris. \"Although the efficiency (of the rescue work) has improved since the 20th, it will take at least 15 days to clear the rescue channel in the main shaft due to the voluminous size of the obstacles,\" Gong said.  The miners have already been trapped underground for 12 days.  Gong added that rescuers are trying various different ways to clear the obstacles, including the use of high powered machinery and deploying more rescue workers.  Concern is growing for the uncontacted miners. Some of the workers in the chamber are trying to help rescuers locate their missing colleagues by using laser pointers and loudspeakers, but they have received no response, Xinhua reported.  Rescuers have also drilled smaller channels into other sections of the mine and are lowering nutrient solutions and other means to detect breathing or movement, but no signs of life have been encountered.  Rescue workers are reported to have first heard knocking sounds from those trapped on January 17, followed by pulling on iron ropes. On Monday miners were able to get a note to rescuers. Xinhua quoted the note as saying: \"We are heavily exhausted and in urgent need of stomach medicine, painkillers, medical tape, external anti-inflammatory drugs, and three people have high blood pressure.\" Explosions and deaths are not uncommon in Chinese mines. In September, at least 16 workers in southwestern China died after they became trapped underground in a coal mine and exposed to unsafe levels of carbon monoxide, state media reported. And in 2016, dozens of workers were confirmed dead after a gas explosion at a coal mine in the city of Chongqing. © 2019 Cable News Network. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

      "(CNN) - A Georgia man was arrested and charged with scamming almost $1 million from a grocery store and using it to buy clothes, guns and cars, police said.  Tre Brown, 19, was arrested January 14 after he allegedly created false returns at the Kroger store where he worked in Duluth, Georgia, according to a news release from Gwinnett County Police. He was charged with felony theft and released on bond the same day, according to online jail records.  Brown is accused of creating more than 40 returns ranging from $75 to over $87,000 for nonexistent items and putting refunds on several credit cards, according to the police. Detectives allege he stole more than $980,000 over two weeks before corporate employees from the grocery store chain noticed the fraudulent transactions and contacted the police, the news release said. Brown purchased two vehicles with the money, but totaled one of them before his arrest, the police statement said. It did not give details on the number or type of guns that police allege he purchased. A substantial part of money was returned after his arrest, but Gwinnett Police Corporal Collin Flynn said they are still calculating the exact amount. CNN was not able to reach Brown for comment and it is unclear whether he has an attorney. In a statement to CNN, Kroger says it cannot comment on the ongoing investigation. © 2019 Cable News Network.

      "36 Washington Post: DOJ watchdog investigating Atlanta US attorney's resignation\n",
      "http://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_d6b8af3c9813e2fd75aeb1855127cc03\n",
      "(CNN) - The Justice Department inspector general is investigating the sudden departure of former Atlanta US Attorney Byung \"BJay\" Pak, who then-President Donald Trump replaced at the same time that Pak and the state of Georgia had become a focus for Trump in his attempt to overturn the state's certified presidential election results, The Washington Post reported on Thursday. The paper, citing people familiar with the matter, reported that the probe by Inspector General Michael Horowitz appears nascent, noting that investigators had not spoken to Pak and the bounds of the investigation remain unclear. A spokesperson for the inspector general's office declined to comment when reached by CNN. Pak declined to comment to the Post. Pak, a Trump appointee who had served in the office since 2017, left his job abruptly on January 4 as the US attorney for the Northern District of Georgia, which includes Atlanta and Fulton County, citing \"unforeseen circumstances\" in a memo to staff. Pak's departure followed fallout over a phone call the previous weekend in which Trump had pressured Republican Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to \"find\" votes to overturn the election in the state, which he lost to President Joe Biden. In audio of the phone call obtained by CNN and first reported by the Post, Trump is also heard making baseless claims about the state's election and at one point, when questioning the audit of ballots, he tells Raffensperger, \"You have your never-Trumper US attorney there,\" without mentioning a name. The comment appears to reference Pak. Trump, in turn, ordered a US attorney from southern Georgia to take over the Atlanta office, in an unusual move. The Justice Department said the Southern District of Georgia's US attorney, Bobby Christine, who is also a Trump appointee and has been in the job since 2017, would take over as acting head in Atlanta, handling both roles. The Atlanta office's top assistant US attorney, Kurt Erskine, normally would have taken on the acting US attorney role but was passed over.  Two people familiar with the matter told the Post in Thursday's story that a call from a senior Justice Department official in Washington had indicated to Pak that he should resign. Trump was angry at what he viewed as the department's insufficient pursuit of his baseless allegations about Georgia's election and the nation overall, people familiar with the matter told the paper at the time. As CNN has previously reported, there have been no credible allegations of any issues with voting that would have impacted the election, as affirmed by dozens of judges, governors, election officials, the Electoral College, the Justice Department, the Department of Homeland Security and the US Supreme Court. The law firm Alston & Bird announced Thursday that Pak was returning to the firm in February as a partner in its Litigation & Trial Practice Group in Atlanta. Pak was formerly a litigation associate at Alston & Bird and began his private practice career there in 2000, according to a news release from the firm. In the statement from the Justice Department announcing his resignation early this month, Pak said he was grateful to Trump for the opportunity to serve and thanked former Attorneys General William Barr and Jeff Sessions. \"It has been the greatest honor of my professional career to have been able to serve my fellow citizens as the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia,\" he said. \"I have done my best to be thoughtful and consistent, and to provide justice for my fellow citizens in a fair, effective and efficient manner.\" © 2019 Cable News Network.

      "37 Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner move out of DC and lease luxury condo in Miami \n",
      "http://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_58ccd3c8364917e443043fe17372a5a7\n",
      "(CNN) - Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner have moved out of their Washington, DC, home, and have signed a one-year lease on a luxury condo in Miami at the Arte, an expensive oceanfront residential building, a source familiar with the couple's move confirmed to CNN.  The last of their moving trucks departed the now-vacant property in the Kalorama neighborhood of DC Thursday. Trump's and Kushner's items are scheduled to be delivered to Miami, said a source with information on where the trucks were headed. The Wall Street Journal was first to report the Trump-Kushner Miami rental. CNN reached out to a representative for Ivanka Trump and has not immediately received a response. Rents at The Arte, which is noted for its triangular shape, hover in the $40,000-per-month range and units typically sell for between $7 and 15 million.  The condo puts the family closer to the lot of land they purchased last month for $32 million on exclusive Indian Creek Island, also in the Miami area. The source familiar with the couple's move told CNN the family intends to use the condo as they develop and build what they are for now intending to be a more permanent home at Indian Creek.  \"(Indian Creek Island) is one of Miami's most private and sought after neighborhoods, frequented by high net-worth individuals seeking privacy,\" said Dora Puig, who has during her career sold more than $3 billion worth of real estate and is the owner of a luxury boutique brokerage in the area. (Puig was not involved in the sale or purchase of the Trump-Kushner transaction.) Puig said the extreme security measures at Indian Creek enjoyed by residents is one of the main reasons wealthy people are willing to pay into the tens of millions for a piece of land and views of the water surrounding it, waters monitored around the clock by armed private security. Before leaving office, former President Donald Trump signed a memorandum extending US Secret Service protection by six months for all his children, according to a senior US official.  Mar-a-Lago, which is about an hour's drive from Indian Creek, is not a viable option for the Trump-Kushners to set permanent roots, mainly because it is a club with paying members and very little in the way of privacy -- perfect environs for her attention-loving father. CNN has reported on Ivanka Trump's desire to perhaps run for political office in Florida. Trump had a taste of what the state might hold for her politically during her many campaign stops there last fall to stump for her father; she visited Florida multiple times in the run-up to the presidential election, drawing capacity audiences at events as well as raising millions of dollars at fundraisers. Trump and Kushner, their three young children and two live-in nannies resided in the Kalorama rental during their tenure working as senior advisers in the White House. © 2019 Cable News Network.

      "38 'The Simpsons' seemed to get it right again -- by predicting part of the inauguration\n",
      "http://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_1f405cd0fbbe5b068c34b3be5235b7ae\n",
      "(CNN) - First things first: No, \"The Simpsons\" cannot actually predict the future. Yet, as the longest-running sitcom in US history, the timeless series often finds itself aligning with \"life imitates art\" moments that happen years after airing. This week, for example, users on social media couldn't help but wonder at the latest coincidence between Vice President Kamala Harris' outfit during the inauguration and Lisa Simpson's outfit in an episode from 2000.  In \"Bart to the Future,\" Lisa assumes the presidency and asks the now-viral line, \"As you know, we've inherited quite a budget crunch from President Trump.\" In the episode, Lisa wore a purple jacket and pearls. At Wednesday's inauguration, Harris wore a purple jacket and pearls. With Harris serving immediately after Donald Trump's presidency, comparisons by viewers were readily made. The similarities with the inauguration didn't stop there for Simpsons fans. Actor Tom Hanks appeared as a host during a virtual concert Wednesday evening, which aimed to keep with President Joe Biden's theme of national unity in a time of crisis. In \"The Simpsons Movie\" from 2007, Hanks in a cameo role pitches a proposed new Grand Canyon at Springfield, the hometown of the Simpsons.  \"Hello. I'm Tom Hanks. The US government has lost its credibility, so it's borrowing some of mine,\" he says. At the end of the scene, he says, \"If you're gonna pick a government to trust, why not this one?\" Speculation over the show's prescient abilities is nothing new. Fans claim the show predicted, among other instances, the Siegfried and Roy tiger attack, smart watches, \"murder hornets,\" and Disney buying 20th Century Fox.  The show's longevity and its exhausting of possible sitcom scenarios have even been referenced in other comedies, including the \"South Park\" episode, \"The Simpsons Already Did It.\" When asked in 2016 about predicting a Donald Trump presidency so far in advance, writer Dan Greaney told The Hollywood Reporter, \"It was a warning to America.\" \"And that just seemed like the logical last stop before hitting bottom. It was pitched because it was consistent with the vision of America going insane,\" he added. © 2019 Cable News Network. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

      "http://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_aebf0530eb132e9110b66ffcf32570b5\n",
      "Editor's Note: Keeping you in the know, Culture Queue is an ongoing series of recommendations for timely books to read, films to watch and podcasts and music to listen to.  (CNN) - Caches of unopened sarcophagi found in Egypt. Eight miles of Ice Age rock paintings discovered in the Amazon rainforest. An intricate Roman mosaic floor excavated in northern Italy. These are just some of the major archaeological finds of the past year.  If you are endlessly fascinated by these discoveries, Netflix's new movie \"The Dig,\" a historical drama starring Carey Mulligan and Ralph Fiennes, should pique your interest.  Based on a true story, \"The Dig\" retells the story of how a widow and a self-taught archaeologist unearthed an Anglo-Saxon burial ship on a private plot of land in Suffolk, UK, in 1939. The incredible find, which occurred as the specter of World War II loomed over Europe, became one of country's most important treasures and helped dispel the notion that the British Isles were culturally and economically siloed during the Dark Ages. \"The film is about time and the fragility of our existence,\" said screenwriter Moira Buffini, who adapted the script from John Preston's book of the same name, in a video interview. \"It's about the brevity of life and what endures -- what we leave behind us.\" In the movie, Mulligan plays Edith Pretty, a landowner and mother whose husband has died from cancer. Though part of her life has been taken from her and returned to the ground, the earth gives her something in return. Pretty has a hunch about the two large mounds on her land, which is rumored to be a Viking burial site. After she hires Basil Brown, played by Fiennes, to assess and excavate the site, they discover the remains of an 89-foot ship from the 7th century. \"We're digging down to meet the dead,\" Pretty tells Brown in one scene. Enduring impressions As the movie recounts, the wooden boat buried at Sutton Hoo had rotted away entirely, though it left a well-preserved imprint in the dirt, like the fossil of a great beast. Inside was a chamber filled with hundreds of valuable artifacts, including an ornate iron helmet, an intricate golden belt buckle and lavish goods from the Byzantine Empire and Middle East, shining a light on the trade and cultural exchange that took place. The vessel had seemingly been used for a ship burial, whereby large boats were used as tombs for important figures. But there was no trace of the man, presumed to be Anglo-Saxon royalty, who had been buried with the ship. \"I read the coroner's report on the king,\" said Buffini. \"They found nothing: not a tooth, not a hair, nothing of his body. Everything had turned into dust, sand and earth. And yet, you get a feeling of ... the whole society of Europe from what's buried in that boat with him.\" Though the ship's remains are a ghostly presence in \"The Dig,\" the movie focuses on the human stories behind its discovery. Each character grapples with the things they will leave behind, from their physical possessions to their wider legacies. \"If we were to go now, what would be left?\" Buffini recalled the characters asking one another. The screenwriter believes such a question can shift our perspective. \"Everything in you resists the march of time,\" she said. \"And I think it makes you live more fully in the moment.\"\n",

(CNN) - Like millions of other Americans, I was infected with Covid-19 in 2020 -- part of a wave of suffering that came as a direct result of the way the Trump administration failed to manage the pandemic. While I thankfully recovered, it wasn't lost on me that I got sick while reporting on the plight of meat processing workers in Arkansas whose pleas to be seen and heard amid the pandemic were going largely ignored. At the end of four years of a presidency in which journalists like me were regularly declared \"enemies of the people\" and after recovering from Covid-19, I began 2021 wondering how to recover my hope for democracy and sense of faith in the citizens of the United States.  The idea of needing to be in Washington, DC, on Inauguration Day gripped me and wouldn't let go, even after the January 6 insurrection: I had to witness the inauguration of Vice President Kamala Harris, the only woman in my lifetime -- in my mom's and my grandma's and all women in the US's lifetime -- to be elected to the position. I knew I had to be there, but I wasn't expecting to leave with a transformed understanding of what the voice of true power in America could sound like.   Arriving in DC the week before the inauguration, shortly after the White supremacist attempt to take the Capitol, I found myself in the unusual position of -- for the first time in my professional life -- ordering body armor and a helmet which, in light of the storming of the Capitol, was recommended for all journalists covering the inauguration.  In DC, despite 25,000 National Guard troops and an increased police presence on the streets, I found joy and inspiration in what from now on I will call the Amanda Gorman Effect, after the surge of joy and rapt attention the inaugural poet brought forth from the nation and from the women who spoke to me on the streets of DC.   The day of the inauguration, normally some 200,000 tickets are distributed to members of Congress and their constituents. Because of the pandemic and the security concerns, Congress was limited to tickets for themselves and one guest. As the National Guard and police blocked off the streets around the White House and the Capitol and set up checkpoints in preparation for the inauguration, the streets became eerily quiet. I decided to go to Black Lives Matter Plaza (a pedestrian area near the White House, renamed as such in June 2020 by the city's mayor) -- where some Biden supporters had assembled to celebrate.   At Black Lives Matter Plaza, there were girls and women like me who, despite the tension in the city created by the level of militarization, wanted to be present for the beginning of a new era, one in which women like Harris and Gorman, the youth poet laureate, will redefine what power looks and sounds like. Tiffany Jamel, 22, wore a \"Black Lives Matter\" mask and a shirt that read \"Why be a racist, sexist, homophobic or transphobic, when you could just be quiet?\" She said that she began college right after Trump was elected and after graduation, she knew she wanted to come and see what she thought would be the defining inauguration of her life. She drove from Florida to Washington, DC, with two friends to witness the inauguration and described the experience as surreal -- she admitted that until that moment, she didn't think we would see a woman as president or vice president in her lifetime.   Activist Nadine Seiler, 55, said she had been occupying the plaza to protect it from racists -- even sleeping there -- since October. She wore a knitted pink pussy hat and face mask that read MADAM in pink and VP in blue. She had seen the White supremacists march towards the White House on January 6 but had never imagined that they were going to be successful in storming the Capitol. She told me that some Black Lives Matter supporters she knew in the area had been afraid to come to the plaza on Inauguration Day for fear of being harassed or threatened.  Smokey Sims, a BLM activist who had been occupying the plaza and supporting Seiler, said of Harris, \"I am glad we've got a woman in office. I'm glad she's Black. I'm glad she's Asian. And hopefully she'll be president next. That's what I want.\" At the inauguration ceremony, Gorman -- a woman the same age as Jamel -- held the world's attention as she recited her poem \"The Hill We Climb,\" saying, \"The new dawn blooms as we free it. For there is always light, if only we are brave enough to see it -- if only we are brave enough to be it.\"  And in that moment, Jamel and her friends saw that power looks like a 22-year-old poet armed only with her words and a coat the color of sunshine and power looks like a 56-year-old Black and South Asian woman with her husband -- the supportive second gentleman -- by her side.   Gorman, who dreamed of being president as a girl, described herself as a \"skinny Black girl, descended from slaves and raised by a single mother.\" The shadow of violence that loomed over the inauguration was eclipsed by her light, by the way her words began to heal a divided nation.  After four years in which we have all endured the images, words and actions of (mostly) male White power, so many of us are ready for this brave new beginning, one in which we are reminded of the magic of poetry and the way words, arranged just so, can bring us together. © 2019 Cable News Network.

      "41 LeBron James says 'it would be great' for LA Lakers to visit the White House, should Covid-19 protocols allow \n",
      "http://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_c2dac23749dcc98b98ca74c441853105\n",
      "(CNN) - LeBron James has opened up the possibility of the LA Lakers visiting the White House in order to celebrate last year's NBA championship -- if only Covid-19 protocols would allow it.   It had become a tradition for the reigning champion to visit the US president in the season following its triumph, albeit one that's taken a brief hiatus during Donald Trump's time in office.  James' Cleveland Cavaliers were the last team to fulfill the tradition when the players met Barack Obama in 2016 but the Golden State Warriors and Toronto Raptors both since declined invites to meet Trump.  In 2018, the Warriors decided instead to visit the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture in lieu of the traditional White House trip.  However, following the Lakers' victory over the Milwaukee Bucks on Thursday, James said he would be happy to meet Joe Biden's new administration but questioned whether current health and safety regulations would allow it.   The Lakers would have the possibility to visit the White House when it plays the Washington Wizards in the second half of the season.  \"I don't think we've had any conversation with our team,\" James told reporters. \"I have no idea with all the Covid rules and restrictions and everything that's going on with our league. I'm not even sure if we even are allowed to go.  \"It would be great, but I have no idea what we can even do right now besides hotel, arena and home.\" READ: WNBA team, co-owned by Kelly Loeffler, is close to being sold, league says Season-high tally James was speaking after an impressive performance against the Bucks, where he scored a season-high 34 points in his side's 113-106 win.  It's a result that maintains the Lakers' unbeaten form on the road this season, where it's won each of its last eight games.  It was all the more important after coming off the back of a home defeat against the Warriors last time out.  \"Our motivation was not losing two in a row tonight,\" said Lakers forward Anthony Davis.  © 2019 Cable News Network.

      "42 Google threatens to shut down search in Australia\n",
      "http://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_742547d04cf4094610a43759be1f017d\n",
      "Hong Kong  (CNN Business) - Google says it will shut down its search engine in Australia if a controversial bill designed to benefit the news media becomes law. At a Senate hearing in Canberra on Friday, Google Australia Managing Director Mel Silva said the draft legislation \"remains unworkable,\" and would be \"breaking\" the way millions of users searched for content online.  \"If this version of the Code were to become law, it would give us no real choice but to stop making Google Search available in Australia,\" she told lawmakers. \"That would be a bad outcome not just for us, but for the Australian people, media diversity and small businesses who use Google Search.\" The company's main concern with the proposal is that it \"would require payments simply for links and snippets just to news results in Search,\" according to Silva.  \"The free service we offer Australian users, and our business model, has been built on the ability to link freely between websites,\" she said.  Google and Facebook have tussled with publishers for years over how they display their content, with media companies arguing the tech giants should pay them for the privilege. Critics of the two tech firms point out that since they dominate the online advertising business, it puts news publishers in a bind and leaves them scrambling for leftovers. The new legislation would allow certain media outlets to bargain either individually or collectively with Facebook and Google — and to enter arbitration if the parties can't reach an agreement within three months, according to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, which put out the proposed legislation. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison hit back at Google later on Friday. \"Let me be clear. Australia makes our rules for things you can do in Australia. That's done in our parliament. It's done by our government and that's how things work here in Australia and people who want to work with that in Australia, you're very welcome,\" he said at a press conference. \"But we don't respond to threats.\" Asked about Morrison's remarks, Google declined to comment. A warning of 'consequences' Both American tech companies have been vehemently opposed to the code since its introduction last summer. Last August, Google used its homepage to warn Australians that the bill would harm their ability to search and lead to \"consequences\" for YouTube users. The US giant is now proposing three changes to the code, including how it would compensate news publishers. One suggestion is for News Showcase — a program launched by Google last year that aims to pay publishers more than $1 billion over the next three years — to be formalized and expanded in Australia. The company already pays seven publishers in the country for content. The company also wants to amend a requirement that would force Google to notify publishers about changes in its algorithm, saying it should do so only \"to make sure publishers are able to respond to changes that affect them.\" \"There is a clear pathway to a fair and workable Code,\" said Silva. \"Withdrawing our services from Australia is the last thing that I or Google want to have happen — especially when there is another way forward.\" An aggressive battle Facebook is also pushing back. In the same Senate hearing on Friday, Simon Milner, Facebook's vice president of public policy for Asia Pacific, said the company could ultimately block news content in Australia, though he emphasized a commitment \"to make the law workable.\" Milner told lawmakers there was already a \"deterrent effect of this law on investment in the Australian news industry,\" citing a recent decision by Facebook to launch a news product in the United Kingdom instead of Australia.    \"Sir Tim Berners-Lee said, this precedent set by this law could 'make the web unworkable around the world,'\" he added, citing the inventor of the web. Regulators say the legislation is needed to level the playing field for the news media in Australia, as newsrooms across the country have reduced service, closed temporarily or permanently shut down. Similar cases have emerged in other countries. On Thursday, Google announced it would pay news publications in France for the use of their content online in a landmark agreement that could soon be replicated elsewhere in Europe under new copyright laws. — Hanna Ziady contributed to this report. © 2019 Cable News Network.

      "Editor's Note: In a series of essays called \"The Distance,\" Thomas Lake is telling the stories of Americans in the pandemic. Email thomas.lake@cnn.com if you have a story idea. (CNN) - This is just to say I am thinking of you, dear reader, in a time when everything feels breakable. Are you holding it together? I am not. Most days I struggle with grief and rage. I often cover my face with my hands. My fingers keep closing into fists. What is happening to me? To us? Maybe you're like me: afraid, anxious, nervous or feeling whatever else you call that paralyzing sensation that radiates from below the ribcage up into your chest. You can't stop worrying about all you have left to lose. You think you might be losing your mind. I find myself experiencing this mental-health decline even though I have not fallen gravely ill, or lost my job, or lost my home, or been trapped in a long-term care facility, or endured any of the other major tribulations that currently afflict tens of millions of my fellow Americans. And so I wonder: If the pandemic is this bad for me, how much worse is it for you? \"Everyone's struggling,\" Dr. Erica Martin Richards told me on the phone. She's a psychiatrist and a medical director at the Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington, DC, as well as a professor at Johns Hopkins University. She told me her patients are sicker and more anxious than usual. Research and observation tell her that other Americans are having a very hard time. \"Does that include you?\" I asked. \"It does,\" she said. And although her physician's reserve prevented her from saying too much, she admitted that the risk of infection had sometimes made her afraid to go to work. When this is over we will all need help. We already do now. Some of us will get it. Most will not, whether for lack of time or money or motivation. There are not enough counselors to sift through the layers of mental and emotional wreckage and give us all the attention we need. Any counselor doing the job now will also need treatment, like an Army medic wounded in battle. There are deficits everywhere, seen and unseen. Deficits of money. Deficits of fruit and vegetables. Deficits of routine medical and dental care. Deficits of education. Deficits of sleep, rest, productivity and lucid concentration. Deficits of love, or human touch. Deficits of eye contact. Deficits of joy, of laughter, of time with friends at the coffee shop or basketball court. Deficits of quiet solitude for overworked parents, of children's laughter for lonely grandparents. All these unpaid bills will come due: some right away, some a year or a decade from now. One way or another, all of us will pay. Our weaknesses, weaker. Our minds constantly wandering. Does your imagination go to strange places after breakfast? Before dinner? In the middle of a restless night, your failures and regrets playing back in a high-definition theater of guilt? Maybe that's just me. I am thinking of one more deficit, another unmet need. Too many people are grieving the loss of a loved one, unable to hold a proper funeral. Too often this grief is unnoticed. We look away, busy with our own lives, afraid of the mounting horror. At least I do. Let us try now to stare it in the face. I write this two days after the daily Covid-19 death toll reached 4,462, a new record high, the milestone largely forgotten in the noise of rioting and impeachment. Now stop and imagine with me the final departure of 4,462 souls, more than three per minute. They are lined up like jets on a runway. Every 19 seconds, another one rises up out of sight. Each one was once a little boy or girl, someone who got scared in the night and went looking for a hand to hold. Have you ever walked into a child's room at night and listened closely to make sure they were still breathing? Nineteen seconds. Here and gone. No visitors in the room. Now imagine everyone who loved those 4,462 people. What if they could safely gather? You'd need the largest stadium in the world. Every seat would be filled. What if all those people cried at once? Can you imagine the sound? I know someone who cries in the shower, sometimes quietly, sometimes with full-on convulsive sobs. The wails are muffled by the curtain and the door, and the noise of falling water, but sometimes the sound still escapes. The shower is a good place to cry. She says this cascade of water feels like the right amount of tears. Another soul, and another, floating up toward God. An astonishing number of departures. Our Covid-19 death toll may reach 500,000 in February. Larger than the population of Atlanta. Imagine that. My favorite city, with everyone gone. Five Points station, deserted. The playground empty at Centennial Olympic Park. Half a million people dead, and the rest of us damaged in ways we don't yet understand. One year after the nation's first confirmed coronavirus infection, there are reasons for optimism. New cases are decreasing. Vaccinations have begun. President Joe Biden has promised 100 million shots in his first 100 days. In the meantime, we must forgive ourselves for doing a little less. It's OK to soothe yourself with television, Dr. Richards told me. It's OK not to clean the house today. It's OK to have breakfast for dinner. It's OK to not be OK. There are things we can do to help ourselves and each other. Tell your friends you love them. Tell them your troubles and listen to theirs. Show up for those family Zoom calls, whether or not you feel like it. \"There are studies that show the importance of smiling,\" Richards said. \"The importance of prayer. The importance of exercising.\" She regularly does all three. This will get better. First it may get worse. Keep going. Hold on to someone, or something, if only a thread of hope. Reach out to the lonely, and reach out if you're alone. We are far apart, but the distance is shrinking. One day we can all be broken together. © 2019 Cable News Network.

      "http://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_08d03368c8b4f818a4f7a24b22d3520c\n",
      "Hong Kong  (CNN Business) - A futuristic project by Google's parent company Alphabet to provide internet from high flying balloons has burst. Loon, the Alphabet subsidiary that used giant balloons to beam internet to people in remote areas around the world, has announced that it is winding down its operations.  It was formerly part of X, Alphabet's innovative \"moonshot\" factory. In a Medium post announcing the news, Loon CEO Alastair Westgarth explained that the company's business model was ultimately unsustainable. \"While we've found a number of willing partners along the way, we haven't found a way to get the costs low enough to build a long-term, sustainable business,\" he wrote.  \"We talk a lot about connecting the next billion users, but the reality is Loon has been chasing the hardest problem of all in connectivity — the last billion users: The communities in areas too difficult or remote to reach, or the areas where delivering service with existing technologies is just too expensive for everyday people.\" Loon was born in 2011, with engineers using what they described as a \"garbage bag-looking\" balloon for an early prototype. The company went on to conduct years of tests, and in 2018, it was spun off from X to become its own Alphabet subsidiary. The company based its technology on an eye-catching premise: that balloons would act as \"floating base stations,\" which could cover a much larger area  — about 200 times more — than a station on the ground. Its balloons were generally positioned about 20 kilometers (12 miles) above Earth. In recent years, Loon had built a name for itself by connecting people during natural disasters. In 2017, it helped bring internet to tens of thousands of people in Peru after massive flooding, and after Hurricane Maria, it helped about 200,000 people get online in Puerto Rico. Last year, the company also brought its balloons to Africa, marking the first commercial launch of a service of its kind in the region. Telkom Kenya, the mobile service provider it partnered with, said Friday that it would discontinue the pilot with Loon in March. The news also marks the end of another strategic partnership. In 2019, SoftBank unit HAPSMobile invested $125 million into Loon. The companies said they would team up to \"bring more people, places, and things online.\" HAPSMobile did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday. © 2019 Cable News Network.

      "http://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_5102275b10cde9750891d2f67c1026a4\n",
      "Seoul  (CNN) - A former Olympic speed skating coach has been jailed for 10 years by a South Korean court for sexual abuse.  Cho Jae-beom, who coached some of South Korea's top skaters, was first accused of physical and verbal assault by several skaters, including former gold medalist Shim Suk-hee, in early 2018, and later sentenced to 10 months in prison.  In December that year, Shim revealed that the abuse went far beyond what had initially been revealed, accusing Cho of rape and sexual assault. Her claims caused a storm within the South Korean sporting world, with several other athletes coming forward, both anonymously and in public, to disclose instances of abuse by coaches.  \"The recent series of testimonies about violence and sexual assault in the sports industry represent our shame that has been hidden beneath the glorious appearance of Korea as a sports powerhouse,\" South Korean President Moon Jae-in said at the time.  While Cho denied the sexual assault allegations, on Thursday a court in Suwon found him guilty on multiple counts, sentencing him to 10 years and six months in prison, as well as 200 hours of rehabilitation.  In a statement, the court said that Cho \"sexually assaulted and molested the victim for years\" and took advantage of her \"inability to resist\" due to his position of authority and previous physical abuse of her.  \"The accused was in the process of building his career as a coach of the nation's national short track speed skating team, but behind it, he routinely raped and molested his underage students over the years,\" the court said, adding that Shim had \"suffered serious mental damage due to continuous sexual violence from the time of childhood and adolescence.\"  The judge said that after Shim had \"mustered the courage to reveal the crimes of the accused, she had to endure an additional two years of psychological trauma\" over the course of the investigation and trial.  Shim's attorney welcomed the verdict in a statement, saying it held Cho to account for his \"habitual sex crimes against young players.\"  \"The ruling confirms that the defendant's actions are serious crimes that should not be tolerated in our society, and shows how the darkest parts of our society should be dealt with in the future,\" the statement said.  It added that Shim \"sincerely hopes that today's ruling will help the victims somewhere in our society speak out and incidents like this will never happen again.\" Park Seong-min, a lawmaker with the ruling Democratic Party, derided the sentence as too lenient, however, noting that prosecutors had originally asked for a 20 year prison term.  \"The dull (gender) sensitivity of the judiciary is deplorable,\" Park said, adding that the sentence given was a \"slap on the wrist\" considering Cho's crimes. South Korea's human rights commission is currently carrying out an investigation, launched following Shim's revelations, into instances of sexual and physical abuse in 50 sports and including both child and adult athletes across a range of levels.  \"The seriousness of assaults including sexual assaults in the industry has reached a situation that can no longer be overlooked,\" commission chairwoman Choi Young-ae told reporters in 2018. \"It's a crucial time to establish a fundamental and comprehensive improvement plan, rather than a temporary one.\" Also this week, a court in Daegu sentenced a former team doctor for the Gyeongju City Hall triathlon squad to eight years in prison for sexual assault. The court said Ahn Joo-hyeon abused multiple athletes, including Choi Suk-hyeon, who later died by suicide.  Whistle blowers have long pointed to the culture of South Korean sports -- particularly elite Olympic sports -- as cultivating abuse. Yeo Jun-hyung, a former skater and coach, set up a support group for young skaters because he said accusations were repeatedly swept under the rug by officials and sports associations. \"Inside the sports world, people think violence and verbal abuse are natural, athletes too,\" one 18-year-old skater told CNN in 2018. \"Even if they get hurt and find it hard, people don't speak up about it.\" © 2019 Cable News Network.
